	abstract = {Real patterns of ecological connectivity are seldom explicitly or systematically accounted for systematic conservation planning, in part because commonly used decision support systems can only capture simplistic notions of connectivity. Conventionally, the surrogates used to represent connectivity in conservation plans have assumed the connection between two sites to be symmetric in strength. In reality, ecological linkages between sites are rarely symmetric and often strongly asymmetric. Here, we develop a novel formulation that enabled us to incorporate asymmetric connectivity into the conservation decision support system Marxan. We illustrate this approach using hypothetical examples of a river catchment and a group of reefs, and then apply it to case studies in the Snowy River catchment and Great Barrier Reef, Australia. We show that incorporating asymmetric ecological connectivity in systematic reserve design leads to solutions that more effectively capture connectivity patterns, relative to either ignoring connectivity or assuming symmetric connectivity.},

	abstract = {Seaweed cultivation is gaining interest world-wide for both food and non-food applications. Global seaweed aquaculture production currently exceeds 32 Mt {WW} per annum but is dominated (86\% of total) by Asian countries. To meet future demand for seaweed products, regions beyond Asia with aquaculture production potential are being explored. The goal of this study was to assess the suitability of the native kelp
              Macrocystis pyrifera
              (Phaeophyceae, Laminariales), for aquaculture in Tasmania, south-eastern Australia.
              M. pyrifera
              was cultivated on seeded twine on loops (1 – 5 m depth) along 100-m longlines at two sites (Okehampton Bay and Great Taylor Bay) from April-November 2020. Temporal and spatial variability in (1) yield (kg m
              -1
              , {WW}), (2) biofouling (\% coverage), and (3) biochemical composition (including proximate composition, fatty acids, dietary minerals, heavy metal profiling, C, N, H, S concentrations and C:N ratio, antioxidants (phenolic compounds), and pigments (Chl-
              a
              , Chl-
              c
              , fucoxanthin)) was compared amongst the two cultivation sites, at two depths (1 and 5 m) from harvests between July – November 2020. Yield (kg m
              -1
              , {WW}) did not significantly change across harvest times, but was greater at a depth of 1 m compared to 5 m. Biofouling on the kelp blades increased significantly in early spring (September). The biochemical composition of the cultured biomass varied over time, between sites and with depth for most of the compounds analysed. Higher lipid, protein and ash content was reported for cultures cultivated at Okehampton Bay compared to Great Taylor Bay and at 5 m compared to 1 m depth, and levels of these macronutrients decreased during the harvest period. The iodine content was slightly above the tolerable content for dried seaweed products in Australia and New Zealand. The combined results of yield, biofouling, and biochemical composition suggest that, for an April deployment at the sites investigated,
              M. pyrifera
              should be harvested in July-August (mid to late winter) to optimise yield and quality of the cultured kelp biomass. These findings provide a better understanding of the variation in growth and quality of cultivated M. pyrifera 
biomass in the region, and inform future management and development of kelp aquaculture in south-eastern Australia and in a global context.},

	abstract = {Macroalgal cultivation is expanding rapidly, and promises to contribute significantly towards future food and energy security, sustainable livelihoods, ecosystem services and habitat provisioning for a range of associated organisms globally. Habitat provisioning underpins biodiversity and ecosystem structure and functioning, supports many ecosystem services and has possible benefits to other marine industries, including enhancement of commercial fish stocks. In macroalgal cultivation, however, only recently has habitat provisioning started to be assessed at a local scale (within a farm's footprint) and with a range of different approaches. This review evaluates techniques used to quantify habitat provisioning in and around macroalgal cultivation sites, for species ranging from microorganisms to megafauna, and outlines recommendations to enable a more comprehensive ecological valuation of macroalgal cultivation in the future. The majority of information on biodiversity associated with macroalgal cultivation is associated with quantifying biofouling or pest organisms, rather than the contribution of colonising species to healthy ecosystem functioning. We suggest how better monitoring of macroalgal cultivation could enable an ecosystem approach to aquaculture ({EAA}) in the future. To achieve this, we highlight the need for standardised and robust methods for quantifying habitat provisioning that will enable assessment and monitoring of macroalgal cultivation sites of varying scales and within different regions and environmental settings. Increased evidence for the potential habitat value of macroalgal cultivation sites will help inform and shape marine legislation, licencing and certification for macroalgal farmers and potentially reduce marine user conflicts, helping the industry to continue to grow sustainably using {EAA}.},

	abstract = {Offshore aquaculture has the potential to expand the macroalgal industry. However, moving into deeper waters requires suspended structures that will present novel farm-environment interactions. Here, we present a computational modeling framework, the Macroalgal Cultivation Modeling System ({MACMODS}), to explore within-farm modiﬁcations to light, seawater ﬂow, and nutrient ﬁelds across time and space scales relevant to macroalgae. A regional ocean model informs the site-speciﬁc setting, the Santa Barbara Channel in the Southern California Bight. A ﬁne-scale hydrodynamic model predicts modiﬁed ﬂows and turbulent mixing within the farm. A spatially resolved macroalgal growth model, parameterized for giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, predicts kelp biomass. Key ﬁndings from model integration are that regional ocean conditions set overall farm performance, while ﬁne-scale within-farm circulation and nutrient delivery are important to resolve variation in within-farm macroalgal performance. Therefore, we conclude that models resolving within-farm dynamics can provide beneﬁt to farmers with insight on how farm design and regional ocean conditions interact to inﬂuence overall yield. Here, the presence of repeating longlines aligned with the mean current generate ﬂow diversions around the farm as well as attached Langmuir circulations and increased turbulence intensity. These ﬂow-induced phenomena lead to less biomass in the interior portion of the farm relative to the edges. We also ﬁnd that there is an efﬂuent “footprint” that extends as much as 20 km beyond the farm. In this regard, {MACMODS} can be used to not only evaluate farm design and cultivation practices that maximize yield but also explore interactions between the farm and ecosystem in order to minimize impacts.},

At present, market competitiveness in aquaculture is growing steadily and the amount of data that producers have to manage is increasing. In this context, bioeconomic models are a crucial tool for improving the efficiency of decision-making processes. This paper reviews the literature on bioeconomic modelling in aquaculture from 2004 to 2015. In order to find the papers reviewed in the present study, an exhaustive online search was conducted in various databases that contain papers published in the most relevant journals in this area of research. After identifying the application of these models to aquaculture throughout the last decade, an analysis was developed for the papers published in the three main research areas: aquaculture management, economic viability and risk management. The last section presents a discussion about the types of relationships modelled, the data used, the estimation techniques, and the limitations and challenges within this discipline that would improve knowledge about aquaculture management.},

	abstract = {Qualifying and quantifying nutrient flows within open-water Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture ({IMTA}) systems is necessary to determine transfer efficiencies and to assess overall system performance. There are numerous empirical performance metrics, such as spatially defined growth and nutrient sequestration, which may have application. When used in combination with modelling techniques, empirical approaches can be a powerful tool for system assessment or prediction. Simple empirical growth models, such as the thermal-growth coefficient ({TGC}) and scope for growth ({SFG}), are applicable to aquatic animals and can include nutritional mass-balance approaches to estimate nutrient loads. Comparable empirical growth models exist for seaweeds. Mechanistic-based dynamic growth and reproduction models, such as Dynamic Energy Budget ({DEB}), are more complex, but have application beyond site-specific empirical models and can, therefore, be included into larger ecosystem models for application to {IMTA}. Proximity, ecological transfer efficiencies, particle dynamics, species culture ratios and the timing of multi-species production cycles can have profound implications for {IMTA} effectiveness and require careful consideration for system assessment. This review provides a pragmatic evaluation of performance measures and models to assess nutrient transfer and growth in open-water {IMTA} systems.},

	abstract = {Urea is an available and readily used source of nitrogen for giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, but little is known about its potential importance for sustaining growth. Results of kinetic experiments indicate urea uptake saturates at an average maximum rate (Vmax) of 0.73–0.92 μmol N g dw−1 h−1 with a half saturation constant (Ks) of 1.02–1.08 μM. The affinity of giant kelp for urea was high relative to that reported for other seaweeds. However, results of similar kinetics experiments with natural, co-occurring phytoplankton communities indicate that the rate of urea uptake by phytoplankton was {\textgreater} 10-fold higher than that of giant kelp. Urea uptake by giant kelp decreased 3–12\% in darkness (relative to in light) compared to a 66–85\% decline for phytoplankton. Similar differences were observed for ammonium and nitrate, suggesting that light intensity and photocycles influence the outcome of competition for N between giant kelp and phytoplankton. Monthly measures of urease in kelp tissues revealed persistent activity at levels that were 100-fold higher than rates of urea uptake (0.13–0.35 μmol N g fw−1 min−1). This finding, coupled with unsuccessful efforts to induce additional urease activity through substrate additions, suggests that urease plays a role in giant kelp physiology beyond that of processing urea taken up from the environment. Collectively, our results suggest giant kelp uses multiple forms of N including urea to sustain year-round growth. Its consistent capacity to acquire N during both day and night may help offset its low uptake rates relative to phytoplankton and increase its ability to compete for N during periods of low N availability.},

Harvesting pressures can change population dynamics, mainly in {OAAs}. In particular, harvesting may alter the chemical components of plants. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the harvesting effects on the chemical composition of L. berteroana from {MEABR} and {OAA} sampled during different seasons (spring and fall) and at two sites (Talquilla and Lagunillas) near Coquimbo (30°S), Chile. The crude protein (13.5 ± 1.0\%), total lipids (0.9 ± 0.2\%), crude fiber (16.3 ± 1.6\%), ash (30.1 ± 1.5\%), and nitrogen-free extract (39.2 ± 2.0\%) contents of L. berteroana were within reference values for Laminariales species. Population descriptors and chemical analyses showed that harvesting had local effects, rather than being affected by a resource management strategy ({OAA} vs {MEABR}). The seasonal anticipator nature of L. berteroana may explain the detected seasonality of it's chemical composition. Regarding functional morphological structures, chemical composition in the fronds was more variable than in the stipes and perennial holdfast, probably since leaves are ephemeral structures susceptible to environmental changes and that play a functional, rather than structural, role in kelp. In the context of Chilean kelp resource management, monitoring chemical composition is useful for determining optimal harvesting periods to local scale and for deciding when commercially valuable compounds, such as alginate, should be extracted. These data also complement harvesting pressure indicators based on L. berteroana demographic parameters.},

	abstract = {Marine reserve design often involves a tradeoff between meeting conservation goals (persistence of fished populations) and minimizing economic costs (lost fishing grounds). Optimization tools such as Marxan navigate that tradeoff by finding reserve configurations that minimize economic costs while protecting some minimum fraction of fish habitat. However, typical Marxan implementations do not account for patterns of larval connectivity among reserves, a factor known to be the key to population dynamics. We show how connectivity information (self-recruitment and network centrality) can be incorporated into the optimization. We then used a spatially explicit population model to compare the performance of reserves designed using habitat information alone or including connectivity. Incorporating connectivity information improved reserve performance for some species but not others. We conclude that including connectivity information can improve reserve design algorithms, but it is essential to evaluate species’ population dynamics to determine which species will benefit from a given reserve network.},

We found that the gonad index of S. nudus in kelp beds was higher than that of those in the fticoid bed. No significant difference was found in the gonad index of H. pulcherrimus from kelp and fucoid beds. The lantern indices of S. nudus in kelp beds and those fed with kelp were significantly lower than those in fucoid and coralline algal beds, and the starved ones and the carbon content of lantern in the kelp bed was also significantly lower than those in fucoid bed. Both species of sea urchins fed on kelp had increases in the gut index, carbon content and the C:N ratio of gut. The C:N ratios of the predominant algae in each bed were 1.2-6.0 times higher than those of the whole body of both species of sea urchin. There were no significant differences in the C:N ratios in the gonads among animals receiving the same treatment, and the C:N ratios in S. nudus were higher than those in H. pulcherrimus. These results suggest carbon and nitrogen compositions changed in the Aristotleos lantern of S. nudus and gut of S. nudus and H. puicherrimus in an imbalanced manner, while the composition of the gonads during the growth stage is stable and may be homeostatic for each species.},

Experimental diets were supplemented with coated {CAA} or non-coated {CAA} to simulate the dietary amino acid profile to that found in the whole body protein of shrimp. The four diets contained {CAA} coated with either carboxymethyl cellulose ({CMC}) (diet 1), zein (diet 2), k-carrageenan (diet 3) or agar (diet 4), respectively. Another four diets contained {CMC}-coated {CAA} with the addition of either zein (diet 5), casein-gelatin (diet 6), zein and k-carrageenan (diet 7), or casein-gelatin and k-carrageenan (diet 8), respectively. The 8 weeks feeding trial demonstrated that the diets containing coated {CAA} gave significantly higher weight gains than diets containing non-coated {CAA}, with the highest value for the diet 6. The diets containing coated {CAA} also yielded higher feed conversion efficiency, protein efficiency ratio, and specific growth rate than diets containing non-coated {CAA}. Leaching trials suggested that shrimp growth performance was improved partly due to the retardation or reduction of {CAA} leaching by coating them with specific binders.},

	url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/30164202},
	abstract = {We examined the accuracy of hydrogen isotope dilution (tritium and deuterium) as a means of determining total body water ({TBW}), and hence body composition, by comparison with whole-carcass chemical analysis in five adult female and four pup Antarctic fur seals. On average, tritium isotope ({HTO}) dilution overestimated {TBW} by 1.92\% ± 1.00\% (n = 9). Deuterium isotope (D₂O) dilution also overestimated {TBW} (1.71\% ± 1.74\%, n = 5), but this trend was not significant. The following equations were developed for predicting {TBW} from hydrogen isotope dilution estimates: {TBW} (kg) = 0.11 + 0.97 · {HTO} space (kg) (r² = 0.999, n = 9, P {\textless} 0.0001) and {TBW} (kg) = 2.10 + 0.89 · D₂O space (kg) (r² = 0.980, n = 5, P {\textless} 0.001). Whole-carcass chemical analysis showed adult females were composed of 14.5\% ± 1.0\% total body lipid ({TBL}), whereas pups were composed of only 9.4\% ± 1.0\% lipid. Adult females had lower {TBW} contents (60.1\% ± 0.7\%) than pups (67.6\% ± 1.2\%) and, consequently, higher energy contents (adults, 10.59 ± 0.30 {MJ} · kg⁻¹; pups, 8.24 ± 0.41 {MJ} · kg⁻¹). Pups had higher ratios of {TBW} to lean body mass ({LBM}) (0.747 ± 0.009) than adults (0.707 ± 0.004), which indicates they had not yet reached chemical maturity. The following best-fit predictive equations based on {TBW} and body mass ({BM}) were developed for {TBL}, total body protein ({TBP}), total body ash ({TBA}), and total body gross energy ({TBGE}): {TBL} (kg) = 0.875 · {BM} (kg) - 1.187 · {TBW} (kg) - 0.633 (adults); {TBL} (\%) = 66562 - 0.845 · {TBW} (\%) (pups); {TBP} (kg) = 0.058 · {BM} (kg) + 0.209 · {TBW} (kg) + 0.996 (adults); {TBP} (kg) = 0.267 · {BM} (kg) - 0.130 · {STBW} (kg) + 0.087 (pups); {TBA} (kg) = 0.071 · {TBW} (kg) - 0.088 (adults and pups); {TBGE} ({MJ} · kg⁻¹) = 34.1 - 0.391 · {TBW} (\%) (adults); {TBGE} ({MJ} · kg⁻¹) = 31. 7 - 0.347 · {TBW} (\%) (pups). With the use of these predictive equations, hydrogen isotope dilution is an accurate means of determining body composition in live Antarctic fur seals. Differences in these relationships between adults and pups, and in comparison to those in phocids, emphasize the need for the use of equations derived from appropriate data sets when predicting body composition in pinnipeds.},

	abstract = {Freshwater pond polyculture faces many challenges in Europe. Appropriate tools must be developed to better understand and manage trophic interactions in pond ecosystems. The objective of our study was to understand the trophic interactions and make inference on the fish diet in common carp polyculture through a combination of experiments and trophic web modeling. We conducted an experiment in small fishponds of common carp polyculture reared with roach and perch and used Ecopath with Ecosim software to characterize the food web. Two replicates of 3 treatments were performed: a semi-extensive pond with low fish density and no formulated feed, an intensive pond with twice the fish density and formulated feed and an intensive pond coupled with a planted lagoon. Ten trophic groups were defined to describe the food web. The modeling procedure enabled us to estimate the diets of each trophic group. The fish diet in fed and non-fed treatments differed greatly since the carp fed mainly on formulated feed when available. The roach exhibited trophic plasticity by adapting their diet to the available resources. The benthic macroinvertebrates and zooplankton were preyed upon intensively; they became the limiting factors for fish production and depended on phytoplankton availability. Detritus and phytoplankton were the main sources of nutrients in all treatments but were not used efficiently. These results provide several insights for improving polyculture. In particular, they promote better management of zooplankton and macroinvertebrates as food sources for target species and a better balance in fish assemblages for more efficient use of resources.},

	url = {https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/etd/2678},
	abstract = {Cell density (mass per volume) is a fundamental physical property of a phytoplankton cell, because it influences sinking, dispersal, and flow-cell interaction. Marine phytoplankton can alter their cell densities, likely through changes in ionic composition in the case of diatoms, and hence control their sinking and floatation rates (Smayda, 1970; Villareal, 1988). Surprisingly, there are no direct measurements of the densities of marine phytoplankton, and, thus, we know little about the relationships between cell density, cell size, and physiological factors, such as growth phase and nutrient and light availability. Using density-gradient centrifugation with sodium polytungstate-seawater gradients, I measured the cell density of diatom cells and chains. To investigate relationships between cell density, and cell size, I focused on diatoms of the same genus, Coscinodiscus radiatus (two clones with average cell diameters (d) of 55 and 100 mm) and Coscinodiscus wailesii (d = 165 mm). Cell density of the three sizes or species was also modeled as a function of changes in the densities and volume fractions of three cell structural components: the cytoplasm, the cell wall (frustule), and the cell vacuole. Assuming no changes in physiology or frustule thickness (using literature values), I expected that larger cells would be less dense than small cells. Within a single genus (Coscinodiscus), median cell density decreased with increasing cell diameter. Observations and model showed the same general trend, but the range of cell densities predicted by the model was narrower than the range measured for living cells. Measurements from previous studies have shown enhanced sinking during the stationary phase of growth and under nutrient and light depletion. Thus, I expected that these cells would be denser than exponentially growing, nutrient- and light-replete cells. I studied both species of Coscinodiscus and included a chain-forming diatom, Stephanopyxis turris, to include other species of different morphologies. Contrary to expectation, cell density of C. radiatus decreased during stationary phase, but C. wailesii density did not change significantly. To specifically test for the effect of nutrient depletion on cell density, cells were inoculated into media that represents nutrient conditions in the Gulf of Maine during spring. Nutrients in the media were depleted about 5 days after inoculation. Cell density of C. wailesii increased slightly after nutrient depletion (Mann-Whitney U test, p=0.02; rnr = 1.09 and rnd =1.11 g cm-3 for nutrient-deplete and nutrient-replete cells, respectively). The same trend was observed for S. turris (Mann-Whitney U test, pnr =1.06},

	abstract = {Seaweeds are potentially a valuable resource for the food, drink and pharmaceutical sectors. The effective utilization of seaweed usually requires post-harvest dehydration in order to prevent decomposition, increase shelf life and aid the extraction of certain chemical constituents. Drying is an expensive, time-consuming and energy-intensive process. Here, the presence of a range of nutritionally important compounds was studied in five brown seaweeds (Fucus spiralis, Laminaria digitata, Fucus serratus, Halidrys siliquosa, Pelvetia canaliculata) after oven-drying at 40 and 60 °C, freeze-drying and microwave-drying at 385, 540 and 700 W. Antioxidant potential (total flavonoid content, total phenolic content, total antioxidant capacity and radical scavenging activity), soluble protein, lipid, amino acid and fatty acid profiles were determined in each case. Overall, results showed that low-temperature drying, such as freeze-drying and oven-drying at 40 °C, produced products with higher concentrations of nutritionally important chemicals, as well as stronger antioxidant activities. Results suggest that concentrations of nutritionally important chemicals and antioxidant activity are influenced by both the drying treatment and seaweed species used. Where rapid drying techniques are found to be beneficial to levels of specific chemicals, microwave-drying could be a useful alternative to oven-drying, as it helps overcome issues associated with prolonged duration drying (contamination and oxidation). No single drying procedure could be identified as consistently superior for all species or all compounds of interest—indicating that the appropriate drying technique should be selected and optimized for each seaweed species whilst also taking into account potential end-use of the final product.},

The lipid and carbohydrate contents showed lower levels (5.1–9.6\% and 3.1–9.1\% dry weight, respectively). No significant differences in general biochemical composition were found between gammarid and caprellid species. The most abundant fatty acids were the polyunsaturated ones (38.3\%) with high levels of {EPA} (20:5(n-3)) with 8.5 to 17.7\%, {DHA} (22:6(n-3)) with 0.9 to 13.6\% and {ARA} (20:4(n-6)) with 1.7 to 5.8\%. Caprellid species were characterized by a higher percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids, while the freshwater gammarid species showed the lowest levels. According to lipid classes, caprellids had higher phospholipids levels and lower triacylglycerol levels, as well as a higher content of polar lipids than the gammarids, being more suitable for their use in aquaculture. Differences in the general biochemical composition between species can be related to habitat characteristics, diets and environmental conditions.

Comparing consumption and respiration to total system throughput suggests lower energy use in the fish farm, resulting in an accumulation of detritus. The production to total system throughput ratio was low due to the low efficiency of the modelled ecosystem. The connectance and system omnivory indexes were low, typical of a simple or immature food web in terms of structure and dynamics. Artificial food pellets provided energy and nutrients to sustain system function and generate a considerable reserve from which it can draw to meet unexpected perturbations.

We showed that C and N per cell tend to decrease with increasing Fe limitation (i.e. decreasing growth rate), both under high light ({HL}) and low light ({LL}). We observed an increase (T. oceanica, {LL}), no change (T. oceanica, {HL}) and a decrease (D. brightwellii, {HL} and {LL}) in {BSi} per cell with increasing degree of limitation. The comparison with literature data showed that the trend in C and N per cell for other Fe limited diatoms was similar to ours. Interspecific differences in C and N quotas of Fe limited diatoms observed in the literature seem thus to be mostly due to variations in cell volume. On the contrary, there was no global trend in {BSi} per cell or per cell volume, which suggests that other interspecific differences than Fe-induced variations in cell volume influence the degree of silicification. The relative variations in C:N, Si:C and Si:N versus the relative variation in specific growth rate (i.e. μ:μmax) followed the same patterns for T. oceanica and D. brightwellii, whatever the irradiance level. However, the variations of C:N under Fe limitation reported in the literature for other diatoms are contrasted, which may thus be more related to growth conditions than to interspecific differences. As observed in other studies, Si:C and Si:N ratios increased by more than 2-fold between 100\% and 40\% of μmax. Under more severe limitation ({HL} and {LL}), we observed for the first time a decrease in these ratios.},

These systems are also highly susceptible to degradation. Aquaculture is a rapidly increasing industry capable of impacting these sensitive systems. Dense human populations and intensive multiple uses of ecologically sensitive coastal waters have forced resource managers to evaluate the impact of expanding shellfish aquaculture to ensure sustainable development. A mass-balance ecosystem model of highly flushed temperate lagoons in Rhode Island, {USA} was constructed to calculate the ecological carrying capacity for shellfish aquaculture. Cultured oyster biomass is currently 12tkm-2 live weight and could be increased to 62 times this value before exceeding the ecological carrying capacity of 722tkm-2. The lagoons were found to be a detritus-dominated system with high energy throughput which may permit the high capacity of the system for additional shellfish biomass allowing managers to consider expansion of shellfish aquaculture to densities much higher than comparatively oligotrophic systems could support. Managing by ecological carrying capacity follows an Ecological Approach to Aquaculture by maintaining ecological integrity and the sustainability of the aquaculture industry as well as other human uses of the lagoon system. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The experiment was done in the summer and consisted of two successive 30-d periods. Individuals consumed more of the alga than the prepared feed but the absorption efficiencies were the same. This probably resulted from a higher content of structural carbohydrates in the alga and a higher content of available organic matter in the feed. The amount of organic matter absorbed was the same for both foods. However, the amount of gonad production and the assimilation efficiency was greater for the prepared feed. This indicates the prepared feed is of better nutritional quality. The physiological measurements and production were greater in the first 30-d period when the temperature was {\textless} 20 C than in the second when it was {\textgreater} 21 C.

	abstract = {We estimated reproductive effort (energy expenditures for reproduction, as opposed to maintenance) in Ad61ie penguins breeding at Palmer Station, Antarctica. Data on body composition changes and metabolic rate were obtained using isotopic methods. Ad61ie breeding behavior consists of an initial courtship stage (during which both sexes fast), incubation, the 'guard' stage (when chicks are 1 to 18-28 days old), and the 'creche' stage (from the end of guarding until chicks are 38-45 days old). Both males and females lost considerable mass during the initial stages of the reproductive season, but males fasted longer and lost more mass. Mass losses of both sexes consisted of 66\% depot fat and 34\% lean tissue. Mass and body composition remained constant once birds resumed feeding. The metabolic expenditure for the foraging necessary to accumulate the mass lost while fasting - one component of reproductive effort was about 63 {MJ} in males and 39 {MJ} in females. Field metabolic rates ({FMR}) were low during courtship and while incubating, increasing more than 2-fold when birds resumed foraging. Although mean {FMR} increased between incubation and the creche stage, differences between stages were small and not significant. We used {FMR} data and an energy balance model to estimate the cost of feeding chicks. Results suggest a maintenance {FMR} of about 2.7 x basal metabolism ({BMR}), increasing to 3.4-3.6 x {BMR} during the creche stage. The reproductive effort (as metabolic expenditures) associated with feeding chicks is 31 {MJ} (males) to 36 {MJ} (females). Cumulative reproductive effort is 94 {MJ} in males and 75 {MJ} in females, or 5.3-6.2\% of the annual energy budget. The reproductive effort devoted to chick care does not appear to be constrained by physiological or time limitations. Instead, selection to reduce the risk of predation may prevent the evolution of increased parental care.},

	abstract = {Environmental sustainability of aquaculture is a complex issue involving effects at local (e.g. benthic deterioration), regional (e.g. eutrophication) and global (e.g. catches for feed production) scales as a consequence of farming operations (e.g. waste emissions) and industrial processes involved in the product value chain. Integrating these effects using a holistic and multi-scale framework is essential to assess the environmental sustainability of innovative production systems such as Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture ({IMTA}), in which organisms of different trophic levels are co-cultured on the same farm to minimize aquaculture waste. The environmental performances of theoretical production scenarios of red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus) sea cage monoculture and an open-water {IMTA} co-culturing of red drum and sea cucumber (Holothuria scabra) were assessed with mathematical models at local and global scales. First, the particulate waste bioremediation potential of sea cucumber production was estimated using an individual-based bioenergetic model. Second, environmental impacts of the monoculture and the {IMTA} systems were estimated and compared using life cycle assessment ({LCA}), calculated per kg of edible protein and t of product, including uncertainty analysis. Given the current limits to stocking density observed for sea cucumbers, its co-culture in sea cages suspended beneath finfish nets may decrease slightly (by 0.73\%) farm net particulate waste load and benthic impact. The monoculture and {IMTA} showed little difference in impact because of the large difference in production scales of finfish and sea cucumber species. Removing 100\% of finfish feces particulate waste requires cultivating sea cucumber at scale similar to that of finfish (1.3 kg of sea cucumber per kg of finfish). Nonetheless, {LCA} showed trends in {IMTA} performance: lower eutrophication impact and net primary production use but higher cumulative energy demand and climate change impacts, generating an impact transfer between categories. Intensification of sea cucumber culture could increase local and global environmental benefits, but further research is necessary to design rearing units that can optimize production and/or bioremediation and that can be practically integrated into existing finfish monoculture units. The methodology defined here can be a powerful tool to predict the magnitude of environmental benefits that can be expected from new and complex production systems and to show potential impact transfer between spatial scales. We recommend applying it to other {IMTA} systems and species associations and including socio-economic criteria to fully assess the sustainability of future seafood production systems.},

	abstract = {Adult king penguins annually fast ashore for 1 mo for molting. By the end of molt, they have lost 44\% of their prefasting body mass. About 18\% of new feather synthesis occurs at sea, thus reducing both nutrient requirement and fasting duration. Plumage synthesis continues during the first 3 wk of fasting. Loss of old feathers occurs between day 12 and day 21 of the molt, and it is associated with a peak in daily body mass loss. The dry mass of epidermal structure synthesized during molt is 395 g. Body composition analysis indicates that fat oxidation accounts for 85\% of total energy expenditure. The proportion for protein is 15\%, a value twofold higher than during the breeding (nonmolting) fast. The mean energy expenditure is also 21\% higher during the molting fast (3.04 W/kg). Compared with other birds, the energetic cost of feather synthesis is the lowest in king penguins (85 {kJ}/g) and consequently the energetic efficiency is the highest (25\%). Changes in tissue composition during molt show that integument is the main lipid source (72\% of the lipid loss) and thus the main source of energy (61\% of the total energy expenditure). The integument and the pectoral muscles play a major role in molting protein metabolism, providing 20 and 57\%, respectively, of the total protein needs for feather synthesis and/or energy expenditure. This result emphasizes the role of integument as a protein source, because the large premolting muscle hypertrophy is not sufficient to account for the totality of the protein cost of molt.},

	abstract = {In a field experiment, Tasmanian blue mussels (Mytilus planulatus) were cultured within an Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) farm in North West Bay ({NWB}), Tasmania to test if enhanced mussel performance and reduced organic enrichment resulted from integrated mussel-salmon culture. The performance of mussels grown within the fish farm lease (70 and 100 m from the fish cages) was not appreciably different from that of mussels grown distant to the farm (500 and 1200 m from the fish cages). After culturing mussels for 14 months, no difference among culture sites was indicated for any measured parameter except shell length (P {\textless} 0.0001) and condition index (P {\textless} 0.01). However, these differences among culture sites were minor, with final mean shell lengths and condition index being within 2.0 mm and 11‰, respectively. Growth of mussels cultured within the fish farm was not enhanced due to several contributing factors: (a) solid wastes (feed particles and faeces) from the farm did not significantly increase particulate food concentrations above ambient levels, (b) phytoplankton production within the farm was not enhanced, (c) mussels were cultured too distant to intercept settling particulate wastes emanating from the fish cages, and (d) ambient seston concentrations were consistently above the pseudofaeces threshold concentration, thereby limiting ingestion of fish farm particulate wastes. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The ranking is compared to rankings based on various ecosystem goal functions. The maturity ranking shows a strong negative correlation with relative ascendency, and thus a strong positive correlation with system overhead, a possible measure of ecosystem stability. The analyses suggest that another goal function, exergy, as calculated here is mainly a function of system biomass, and that it might be appropriate to reconsider the computational aspect of exergy estimation. Most importantly the analyses point to the feasibility of using comparisons of ecosystem models as a tool for enhancing our understanding of ecosystem characteristics, notably sustainability.},

	url = {www.ecopath.org},
	abstract = {Ecopath with Ecosim is designed for straightforward construction, parameterization and analysis of mass-balance trophic models of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Focus is on using the models for fisheries management, and a suite of tools are included for this aim. This help system describes how to obtain, install and use the Ecopath software system written for personal computers using the Windows environment. Brief accounts are given of the theory behind the models developed using Ecopath with Ecosim. The Ecopath mass-balance modeling system is built on an approach initially presented by J.J. Polovina for estimating biomass and food consumption of the elements (species or groups of species) of an aquatic ecosystem. Subsequently it was combined with various approaches from theoretical ecology, notably those proposed by R.E. Ulanowicz, for the analysis of flows between the elements of ecosystems. However, the system has been optimized for direct use in fisheries assessment as well as for addressing environmental questions through the inclusion of the temporal dynamic model, Ecosim, and the spatial dynamic model, Ecospace. Since its initial development in the early 1980s, the mass-balance approach incorporated in the Ecopath software has been widely used for constructing food web models of marine and other ecosystems. This has led to a number of generalizations on the structure and functioning of such ecosystems, relevant to the issue of fisheries impacts. Some of these generalizations have revisited older themes, while others were new. Both sets of generalizations have impacted on the development of the Ecopath approach itself. Herein, the description of the average state of an ecosystem, using Ecopath proper, also serves to parameterize systems of coupled difference and differential equations, used to depict changes in biomasses and trophic interactions in time (Ecosim) and space (Ecospace). The results of these simulations can then be used to modify the initial Ecopath parameterization, and the simulations rerun until external validation is achieved. This reconceptualization of the Ecopath approach as an iterative process, which helps address issues of structural uncertainty, does not, however, markedly increase its input requirements. Rather, it has become possible, through a semi-Bayesian resampling routine to explicitly consider the numerical uncertainty associated with these inputs. Real ecosystems are more complicated than the mass-balance fluxes of biomass in Ecopath, however large the number of functional groups we include in our models. Real ecosystems also have dynamics far more complex than represented in Ecosim. The issue to consider, when evaluating the realism of simulation software, is, however, not how complex the software and the processes are that are represented therein. Rather, the question is which structure allows a representation of the basic features of an ecosystem, given a limited amount of inputs. On such criterion, it was obvious that a major deficiency of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach was its assumption of homogenous spatial behavior. This has been remedied through the development of Ecospace (Note that in Walters et al., 1999 Equation 13, the sign for the T' factor was reversed by mistake.), a dynamic, spatial version of Ecopath, incorporating all key elements of Ecosim (incl. different vulnerabilities and split pools, see above). The Ecopath with Ecosim software had by 2003 been distributed to more than 2500 registered users in 124 countries, and more than 200 publications utilizing it have appeared in the scientific literature.

generally in excess of measured benthic fluxes, suggesting that {NH}4+ was reassimilated at the sediment surface by microphytobenthos ({MPB}). The ratio of total {CO}2 ({TCO}2):{NH}4+ produced within
the sediment was generally in excess of 15, and in some cases in excess of 60. Significant influxes and effluxes of dissolved organic nitrogen ({DON}) were measured where the activity of {MPB} was highest. At times, {DON} influxes and effluxes were well in
excess of dissolved inorganic nitrogen ({DIN}) fluxes, highlighting the importance of measuring {DON} fluxes where the activity of {MPB} is high. Rates of denitrification were very low, and represented only a small loss of N from the sediment, most probably as
a consequence of the activity of {MPB}. Estimates of nitrogen assimilation by {MPB} showed that N2 fixation was likely to be the major source of nitrogen during the summer at the study site in the upper estuary. There was also a high estimated C:N
ratio ({\textasciitilde}20) of {TCO}2 and nitrogen assimilated at this site, suggesting that a significant proportion of primary production was exuded as dissolved organic carbon rather than cellular production.},

Introduced taxa were strongly represented in the fauna, comprising 45\% of total macrofaunal biomass. Large differences were evident between sites affected by different levels of organic farm waste. Sites located adjacent ({\textless}10 m) to farm cages possessed significantly depressed sediment redox levels, a dominance of capitellid and dorvilleid polychaetes, and low macrofaunal species richness. Subtle impacts extended across farm lease areas in the form of depressed redox potential at 40 mm depth and changes to the macrobenthic community, including a prevalence of the dogwhelk Nassarius nigellus and a paucity of the heart urchin Brissus sp. and the maldanid polychaetes Asychis sp. and Rhodine sp. Minor farm effects were also evident at sites sampled 35 m outside farm lease boundaries, most notably as elevated population numbers of the polychaete Terrebellides sp., bivalve Mysella donaciformis and heart urchin Echinocardium cordatum. Amongst the univariate metrics examined, redox potential at 40 mm depth and the ratio of bivalves to total molluscs provided the most sensitive indicators of farm impacts, with the latter metric relatively insensitive to spatial variation between locations within the region studied.},

	abstract = {In recent decades the eastern stock of Atlantic bluefin tuna Thunnus thynnus thynnus has declined, driven by excessive catches partially mediated by the growth of the capturebased aquaculture of bluefin in the Mediterranean. This study addresses the potential direct and indirect food-web effects on trophic linkages in the ecosystem through the removal of both small pelagic fish species and wild bluefin tuna for aquaculture operations in the Mediterranean. A mass-balanced model representing the southern Catalan Sea during the 1990s was modified to include a bluefin tuna farm partially supplied from fish captured in the area modeled. Six scenarios were developed to simulate possible changes to the capture-based aquaculture operations and possible impacts to the ecosystem. The addition of one bluefin tuna farm in the Catalan Sea did not produce substantial effects in the ecosystem. Simulation scenarios that include the level of production already present in a similar ecosystem in the Murcia region resulted in large fluctuations of both biomass and yield for bluefin tuna, as well as for many species in the modeled ecosystem. Increases in biomass of lower trophic level functional groups were observed with reductions in biomass from higher trophic level predators. These outcomes demonstrate that removal of biomass at top and intermediate trophic levels can have direct and indirect outcomes on the structure of the ecosystem due to the complexity of the food web. Our results suggest, in the case of the Western Mediterranean Sea, increasing bluefin tuna farming activities will likely contribute towards further degradation of an already highly exploited ecosystem. © Inter-Research 2012.},

These earthen ponds behave as simplified ecosystems or mesocosms, with well-defined borders, where the relationships between trophic groups can be described through ecosystem modeling. Different combinations of species were produced in these ponds, corresponding to the 3 treatments: (1) fish, oysters and macroalgae ({FOM}); (2) fish and oysters ({FO}); and (3) fish and macroalgae ({FM}). The managed species were meagre Argyrosomus regius , white seabream Diplodus sargus , flathead grey mullet Mugil cephalus , Japanese oyster Crassostrea gigas and sea lettuce Ulva spp. The results showed that the total amount of energy throughput was 15 to 17 times higher when compared with an equivalent naturalized system. The high biomass and low recycling indicated an immature system with low resilience and low stability that demands high rates of water renewal and aeration to maintain good water-quality levels for finfish production. The addition of oysters and macroalgae in the {FOM} treatment appeared to improve the water quality, since oysters controlled the excess of phytoplankton produced in the ponds by ingesting a fair amount of the phytoplankton, while the macroalgae helped in the absorption of excess nutrients and created a habitat for periphyton and associated macroinvertebrates. Some ecosystem attributes of the {FOM} ponds approached the values of the naturalized model, suggesting a possible path towards more sustainable aquaculture.},

To gain insight into the age-related alterations in protein conformation and water structure, we obtained Raman spectra from the sun-protected buttock skin representing chronologic aging and the sun-exposed forearm skin representing combined effects of photoaging and chronologic aging. Ten aged individuals (five men, five women; age range 74–87) and 10 control young individuals (five men, five women; age range 22–29) entered the study. In the photoaged forearm skin the positions of protein-specific amide I, amide {III}, and {CH} stretching bands were shifted, suggesting increased protein folding. In contrast, major changes were seen only in the amide I peak in chronologically aged skin. The intensity of the 3250 cm–1 {OH} stretching band was increased in photoaged skin (but not in chronologically aged skin) indicating an increased water content. R(ν) representation of the low-frequency region of Raman spectra was applied to determine water structure. In the young skin and chronologically aged skin water was mostly present in the bound form. In the photoaged skin, however, an increase in intensity at 180 cm–1 was noted, which reflects an increase in the not-protein bound water (tetrahedron water clusters). In conclusion, it seems that proteins in the photoaged skin are more compact and interact with water to limited degree. Impairment in protein hydration may add to the understanding of ultrastructural, mechanical, and biochemical changes in structural proteins in the aged skin.},

Sinking organic matter in the shape of fragmented pellets and fish faeces could be ingested by the surrounding fauna attracted to the submerged structures of aquaculture facilities or living in natural benthic habitats. Fatty acids contained in feed pellets were used as trophic markers to shed light on the assimilation and incorporation of aquaculture wastes by the invertebrate fauna associated to sea-cages. Eighteen macroinvertebrate species, and zooplankton, seaweeds and sediments were collected from two fish farms, one of which (control) had not been used as such for two years. This study demonstrates that macroinvertebrate fauna present in fouling can take up sinking organic matter from farms. Further research should be directed at assessing the potential implications of aquaculture production for the surrounding ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous fasting during reproduction (sometimes with a full stomach) and moult is a major characteristic of the annual cycle of penguins. Long-term fasting (up to four months in male emperor penguins) is anticipated by the accumulation of fat (incubation fast) and of fat and protein (moult fast). During most of the incubation fast, birds rely almost entirely on lipids as an energy source, body proteins being spared. However, below a critical (but non-total) fat store depletion, marked behavioural, metabolic, and endocrine changes occur. Spontaneous locomotor activity increases and the egg is transitorily left unincubated for increasingly long periods, until its definitive abandon and the bird departs to re-feed at sea. These changes are thought to be activated by an endogenous re-feeding signal triggered before lethal energy depletion. An increase in body protein catabolism in the face of a reduction in lipid availability and utilisation, and an increase in circulating corticosterone vs. a decrease in plasma prolactin, are likely to be major metabolic and hormonal components of this signal. The survival and rapid restoration of energy stores in birds having departed to re-feed at a stage of near total lipid depletion demonstrates the effectiveness of the re-feeding signal. Penguins, and possibly other seabirds, are therefore appropriate animal models for understanding the long-term interactions between body energy reserves and fasting, breeding and feeding physiology and behaviour.},

	abstract = {Jatropha curcas (L.) is a multipurpose and drought-resistant tree, widespread throughout the tropics and subtropics. Its seeds are rich in oil and protein (contains 600–660 g kg−1 crude protein similar to fish meal). It is being promoted as a biofuel plant. Jatropha kernel meal obtained after oil extraction is an excellent source of protein. However, presence of toxic and antinutritional constituents restricts its use in fish and shrimp feed. An 8-week experiment was conducted to evaluate the nutritional quality of the detoxified Jatropha kernel meal ({DJKM}) in white leg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei). Shrimp (60) with an initial average body weight of 4.46 ± 0.64 g were randomly distributed into three treatments with four replicates and fed isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets (crude protein 350 g kg−1, crude lipid 90 g kg−1): Control (fish meal-based protein), {JC}25 and {JC}50 (25\% and 50\% of fish meal protein replaced by {DJKM}). Higher (P {\textless} 0.05) body mass gain, specific growth rate and metabolic growth rate were observed in {DJKM}-fed groups than in Control group. However, lower (P {\textgreater} 0.05) feed conversion ratio was observed in {DJKM}-fed groups, while protein efficiency ratio exhibited an opposite trend. Protein, ash and gross energy content of the whole shrimp body were higher (P {\textless} 0.05) in {DJKM}-fed groups compared to Control group. Moisture and lipid content of the whole shrimp body did not differ significantly among the three groups. Cholesterol level in plasma was highest (P {\textless} 0.05) in the Control group, followed by {JC}25 and {JC}50 groups; all being significantly different.

Akaike information criterion analysis was used to compare six different hypothesized dietary composition models across eight growth measurements. Dietary protein level and protein: energy ratio were the best models for prediction of total weight gain. Diets with the highest (≥68.6mgPkcal−1) protein:energy ratios produced the most wet weight gain after 9weeks. Dietary carbohydrate level was a poor predictor for most growth parameters examined in this study. However, the model containing a protein×carbohydrate interaction effect was the best model for protein efficiency ratio ({PER}). {PER} decreased with increasing dietary protein level, more so at higher carbohydrate levels. Food conversion ratio ({FCR}) was best modeled by total dietary energy levels: Higher energy diets produced lower {FCRs}. Dietary protein level was the best model of gonad wet weight gain.

T. hemprichii, collected from a seagrass bed in Xincun Bay, Hainan island of Southern China, was cultured at 4 {CO}2(aq) concentrations in flow-through seawater aquaria bubbled with {CO}2. {CO}2 enrichment considerably enhanced the relative maximum electron transport rate ({RETRmax}) and minimum saturating irradiance (Ek) of T. hemprichii. Leaf growth rate of {CO}2-enriched plants was significantly higher than that in unenriched treatment. Nonstructural carbohydrates ({NSC}) of T. hemprichii, especially in belowground tissues, increased strongly with elevated {CO}2(aq), suggesting a translocation of photosynthate from aboveground to belowground tissues. Carbon content in belowground tissues showed a similar response with {NSC}, while in aboveground tissues, carbon content was not affected by {CO}2 treatments. In contrast, with increasing {CO}2(aq), nitrogen content in aboveground tissues markedly decreased, but nitrogen content in belowground was nearly constant. Carbon: nitrogen ratio in both tissues were obviously enhanced by increasing {CO}2(aq). Thus, these results indicate that T. hemprichii may respond positively to {CO}2-induced acidification of the coastal ocean. Moreover, the {CO}2-stimulated improvement of photosynthesis and {NSC} content may partially offset negative effects of severe environmental disturbance such as underwater light reduction.},

	abstract = {Many benthic quality indices rely on categorising impacts by assigning species to ecological-groups ({EGs}) that reﬂect their tolerance to pollution. This is usually based on best professional judgement ({BPJ}) by experts with access to relevant ecological and taxonomic information. However, international applicability of such indices is restricted in areas where the species taxonomy, biology and response to pollution are poorly understood. In this study we describe an approach that enables objective allocation of {EGs} in situations where species information is limited. This approach utilised {BPJ} to categorise the environmental condition of benthic habitats around ﬁsh farms in New Zealand in relation to deﬁned enrichment stages ({ESs}). Quantile regression was then used to model distributions of select taxa. The experts assigned {ES} scores from 1 to 7, for stations that ranged from relatively natural to excessively enriched (i.e. near-azoic), respectively, with judgements based on a suite of quantitative and qualitative indicators of enrichment, but without reference to detailed species information. The individual {BPJ} estimates were highly correlated, with minimal bias, indicating good agreement among the experts. Forty key indicator taxa were identiﬁed and quantile regression models based on {ES} (derived as a continuous explanatory variable) were ﬁtted for 34. Abundances of the same taxa were also modelled in response to a more traditional enrichment indicator (organic content, \%{OM}) for comparison with the {BPJ} technique. The regression approach characterised enrichment responses and objectively identiﬁed both the upper and lower tolerance limits of a range of taxa according to their {ES} and \%{OM}. The models discriminated a number of key indicator taxa, including several that were responsive to low-level changes in {ES}, but not necessarily \%{OM}. There was reasonable agreement (59\%) between {EGs} derived using the regression approach and those deﬁned using the {AMBI} database (one of the most commonly applied benthic quality indices). Moreover, the regression method allowed the classiﬁcation of 10 additional taxa for which our ecological understanding was limited. A key outcome of this study was the acknowledgement that {EG} characterisations for species need to be regionally validated, no matter how well deﬁned they might appear to be. The combined {BPJ}/regression analysis approach described provides a valid means of both assigning and validating {EG} classiﬁcations, which will be particularly useful in situations where the taxa are poorly deﬁned, and will enable existing biotic indices to be more broadly applied and interpreted.},

In marine systems, temperature appears to drive much of the observed change in biotic communities subject to climate change, but this may reflect the focus of most studies only on temperature without consideration of other environmental variables affected by climate change. The giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera was once abundant in eastern Tasmania, forming extensive habitats of ecological and economic importance, but recent extensive population decline has occurred. Southerly incursion of warm oligotrophic East Australian Current ({EAC}) water has increased in frequency and intensity into this region, which has warmed {\textasciitilde}4 times the global average, and the warming trend is predicted to continue. This study investigated the single and combined effects of temperature, light, and nitrate availability on the physiology of juvenile M. pyrifera sporophytes in a laboratory experiment. Determination of relative growth rate, photosystem {II} characteristics, pigments, elemental chemistry, and nucleic acid characteristics over 28 d showed that all experimental factors affected sporeling physiology. Temperature and light drove much of the observed variation related to performance characteristics, and rapid deterioration of kelp tissue was a consequence of temperature stress (high temperature), photoinhibition (high light), and low light, accompanied by impaired photosynthetic efficiency and increased {RNA} concentration, presumably associated with production of photoprotective proteins. Surprisingly, higher relative growth rates were observed in low-nitrate treatments. These findings suggest that negative effects of temperature on M. pyrifera populations will be mediated by local variation in light and nutrient conditions.},

Here, we present an experimental approach that simultaneously integrates multiple nutritional traits, feeding assays, and juvenile performance to assess whether a marine herbivore (the amphipod Ampithoe valida) regulates the intake of elements (carbon and nitrogen), macronutrients (protein and non-protein) or both when offered freeze-dried tissues of seaweeds varying in nutritional content. We assessed behavioral regulation of nutrients in three ways. First, during no-choice assays, we found that amphipods ingested similar amounts of carbon, but not nitrogen, non-protein and protein, across algal diets. Second, herbivore intake rates of carbon, protein and non-protein components across no-choice assays was similar to intake rates when offered a choice of foods. Third, variation in intake rates of carbon and non-protein components among algal diets was significantly greater than was tissue content of these components, while variation in intake rates of nitrogen was significantly lower; differences in protein intake variation was equivocal. While these analytical approaches are not uniformly consistent, carbon and nitrogen seem to emerge as the nutrient components that are more strongly regulated by A. valida. Juveniles reared on single diets shown patterns of survivorship, growth and reproduction that could not be predicted by these feeding preferences, nor nutrient content. We conclude that an integrative approach that considers the intake of multiple nutrients potentially yields insights into feeding behavior and its performance consequences.},

Ontogenetic allometry and the body composition technique were used to quantitatively describe growth patterns. Although adult males were significantly larger than adult females in total body mass ({TBM}) and total length, overall patterns of growth were remarkably similar between sexes. The integument, locomotor muscle, and vertebral column together represented 50\%–58\% of {TBM} across all life history categories, although their relative contributions varied ontogenetically. Young dolphins invested the greatest percentage of {TBM} in integument, while locomotor muscle was the single largest body component in adults. In both sexes (1) most muscle groups displayed positive allometry, (2) most skeletal elements displayed negative allometric or isometric growth, (3) most abdominal viscera associated with digestion displayed positive allometry, and (4) the brain displayed negative allometric growth.

	abstract = {North Atlantic harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena (L.) face considerable energetic challenges, as they are relatively small marine mammals with an intense reproductive schedule and a cold-water habitat. Post-natal growth of these porpoises was described using ontogenetic allometry and body composition techniques. The cross-sectional sample contained robust calves, immature, and mature porpoises (n= 122) incidentally killed in commercial fishing operations between 1992 and 1998. Total mass and the mass of 26 body components were measured using a standard dissection protocol. Most body components grew similarly in female and male porpoises. Blubber, brain and skull were negatively allometric, while muscle and reproductive tissues exhibited positive allometry. Female heart, liver, intestine and mesenteric lymph node grew at significantly higher rates than in males. Male locomotor muscle and pelvic bones grew significantly faster than in females. High growth rates for visceral and reproductive organs in porpoises, relative to other mammals, may underlie their early maturation and support their intensive, annual reproductive schedule. Relative to other cetaceans, porpoises seem to allocate a larger percentage of their total body mass to blubber. This allocation to blubber, which is greatest in calves (37\% of body mass), may provide harbour porpoises with the thermal insulation required to live in cold water. The factors influencing growth rates and differential investments in body composition seem to change at various stages of a porpoise's life. Energy allocation in porpoises seems to shift from an emphasis on developing an insulative blubber layer in young animals to preparing the body for annual reproduction at sexual maturity.},

	abstract = {Understanding how marine ecosystems are structured and how they function is a scientiﬁc challenge. Nowadays, to learn about ecosystem trophic dynamics ecologists use two complementary methodological approximations, mass-balance ecosystem models and isotopic tools. However, despite the wide applications of these methodologies, the comparison and combination of both are still scarce. The aim of this study was to examine the trophic dynamics of representative species of the South Catalan marine ecosystem (Northwestern Mediterranean) using the Ecopath ecosystem modelling tool and the stable isotope approach. By using the two methodologies we depicted the trophic position (trophic level and δ15N values) and trophic width (omnivory index and total isotopic area) of several species of ﬁsh, cephalopods, cetaceans, seabirds and one sea turtle. Our results show a clear correlation between the trophic levels estimated by the Ecopath model and the δ15N values, which validate the trophic position of several species in the study area and indicate that both methodologies are useful to determine the trophic position of marine species in Mediterranean marine food webs. In contrast, the two estimators of trophic width (the omnivore index and the total isotopic area) were not strongly related, since the relationship between modelling and stable isotope results was evident only for some species. Further comparisons of trophic width calculated in other marine food webs may provide a better understanding of our results and validate the accuracy of both methodological approaches to calculate trophic width.},

	abstract = {Age-related changes in lipid, water, and non-lipid content and energy density of four major body parts (integument, viscera, leg and pectoral muscles, and carcass) of Cape Gannet chicks, juveniles, and adults were studied. The proportion of water was typically high for neonates and decreased during development to near adult levels at fledging. The percentage of lean dry matter remained almost constant for muscles and carcass but decreased in viscera and integument due to fat deposited during growth. Energy density was linearly related to age ({kJ}/g = 4.46 + 0.076 Age (days), r2 = 0.845, P {\textless} 0.001). Fasting capability ({FC}) of chicks (survival time when using only their lipid reserves, calculated from lipid mass and field metabolic rate) increased exponentially up to 70 days of age ({FC} = \$0.6{\textbackslash}text\{e\}{\textasciicircum}\{0.05{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}text\{Age\}\}\$, r2 = 0.815, P {\textless} 0.001). Newly fledged birds have a fasting capability between 8-16 days and adults only 1-2 days. Time between consecutive feeds, from field observations at the nest, for chicks 21-40, 41-60 and 61-80 days old were 11.9 ± 0.7 h, N = 74; 16 ± 1.1 h, N = 50; and 20 ± 0.6 h, N = 35, respectively. The results are contrary to the hypothesis that fat deposits are an insurance against an unpredictable fast, although they may serve for this purpose. Fat deposits may be the physiological consequence of the temporal pattern of feeding by adults, or they may serve as energy sinks to increase energy requirements relative to the nutrient and protein requirements of chicks.},

Feeding ceased during laying and incubation. From prelaying to hatching, total weight declined by 46.4\%, lipid by 81.4\%, and protein by 36.8\%. Daily energy expenditure during laying was 2,528 {kJ}, 5.2 times greater than during incubation. Rate of lipid expenditure during laying was 3.3 times greater than during incubation, and rate of protein expenditure was 8.8 times greater. Of the birds' total prelaying energy, 33.8\% was expended during laying, 34.6\% during incubation, and 31.6\% remained at hatching. An estimated 31.6\% of the energy expended during laying was invested in eggs. Sixteen- and 18-carbon fatty acids dominated in lipid of the fattest and leanest birds. The major nutrient and energy donors during breeding were 16:0 and 18:1 fatty acids. Svalbard eider eggs weighed ca. 17.5\% less and were incubated ca. 1.5 days shorter than eggs from the species' most southerly range limit. This apparent adaptation to arctic existence gave an estimated energy savings of 6.5\% during breeding.},

	abstract = {We studied differences in body composition and basal metabolic rate ({BMR}, measured in postabsorptive birds under thermoneutral conditions at night) in two subspecies of red knots, Calidris canutus: one that spends the nonbreeding season under energetically costly climatic conditions at temperate latitudes (subspecies islandica in western Europe) and one that winters in the hot and humid tropics (subspecies canutus in West and South Africa). To examine whether the possible differences would be upheld under identical conditions, we kept both groups in captivity as well Body composition was quantified with respect to the fat and lean components of 10 "organs" (breast muscles, leg muscles, stomach, intestine, liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, and the skin, and skeleton and attached muscle). Captive birds had lighter lean tissues than wild birds, especially those of the stomach, intestine, kidneys, and liver (the nutritional organs). During the northern winter wild islandica knots had higher lean masses than canutus knots in tropical Africa. Tropically wintering red knots had lower {BMRs} than their temperate-wintering conspecifics, and birds in long-term captivity had lower {BMR} values than their free-living counterparts. Average {BMR} values per category of birds (wild or captive of either subspecies) were strongly correlated with the group averages of lean mass. Prediction of {BMR} on the basis of total lean mass of red knots undergoing incipient starvation follows this same relationship because metabolically active tissue is being depleted. That the two subspecies converged to similar body composition in captivity indicates that individual red knots may possess considerable flexibility. We argue that red knots, and probably most other long-distance migrants, have metabolic machinery that is able to adjust continuously, depending on the ecological conditions and food types encountered in the course of the year. We further argue that variation in (functional components of) lean mass is the vehicle for seasonal adjustments in metabolic physiology to variable demand levels. Body mass adjustments offer a flexible response enabling red knots to economize on total daily metabolic expenditure whenever conditions allow a relaxation of metabolic scope, such as during winter in the Tropics.},

These species were classified according to sex, sexual development (immature, mature) and anatomical zone (mantle, arms). There were no major differences in the {NPN} contents of the three species studied. The anatomical zone clearly marks the difference in {NPN} content, with the content being greater in the mantle than in the arms for all the species. The trimethylamine oxide–nitrogen levels in volador were greater in the mantle than in the arms and these differences were not observed in the other two species. In pota and octopus, however, it is the stage of sexual development that exhibited differences, with a greater quantity of trimethylamine oxide–nitrogen in the immature specimens than the mature ones. The trimethlyl and total volatile basic nitrogen behaviour had no clear trend, the {TVB}-N levels were probably so low that these differences were not important. The same thing occurred with the {pH}, where the lowest values were recorded in octopus and the highest in pota. The free amino acid ({FAA}) compositions varied to a great extent, depending on the species and, to a less extent, depending on the sex, stage of sexual development and anatomical zone. The total {FAA} content was virtually the same in volador and pota, while it was about 75\% lower in octopus. The highest concentrations of {FAA} in the three species were for proline, arginine and alanine, but in different proportions.},

Their plumage was slightly heavier and their breast and belly feathers were longer. There was a large increase in mass in May by first-year and adult birds prior to migration.

	abstract = {There is increasing ﬁshing pressure on the continental margins of the oceans, and this raises concerns about the vulnerability of the ecosystems thriving there. The current knowledge of the biology of deepwater ﬁsh species identiﬁes potential reduced resilience to anthropogenic disturbance. However, there are extreme difﬁculties in sampling the deep sea, resulting in poorly resolved and indirectly obtained food-web relationships. Here, we modelled the ﬂows and biomasses of a Mediterranean deep-sea ecosystem, the Catalan Sea continental slope at depths of 1000–1400 m. This is the ﬁrst model of a deep-water ecosystem in the Mediterranean Sea. The objectives were to (a) quantitatively describe the food web structure of the ecosystem, (b) examine the role of key species in the ecosystem, and (c) explore the vulnerability of this deep-sea ecosystem to potential future ﬁshing exploitation. We used the Ecopath with Ecosim ({EwE}) modelling approach and software to model the ecosystem. The trophic model included 18 consumers, a marine snow group, and a sediment detritus group. Trophic network analysis identiﬁed low levels of consumer biomass cycling and low system omnivory index when compared with expected values of marine ecosystems, and higher cycling and omnivory when compared with available {EwE} models of shallower areas of the Mediterranean Sea. The majority of ﬂows in the ecosystem were concentrated at the trophic level of ﬁrst-order consumers ({TL} 2). Benthic invertebrates and demersal sharks were identiﬁed to have key ecological roles in the ecosystem. We used the dynamic temporal model Ecosim to simulate expansion of the red-shrimp benthic trawl ﬁshery that currently operates at shallower depths, down to 800 m depth. The simulations showed reductions in ﬁsh biomass and that the state of the deep continental slope ecosystem in the western Mediterranean seems to be the result of a long-term succession process, which has reached ecological stability, and is particularly vulnerable to human impact and, speciﬁcally, to ﬁsheries exploitation.},

Six isonitrogenous and isolipid diets containing different {CBH} levels were formulated and fed to juvenile L. vannamei for 42 days in triplicate for each treatment. Weight gain and survival rate of shrimp fed 20\% {CBH} were the greatest and differed from those fed 5\% {CBH} and 30\% {CBH}. Shrimp whole-body crude protein of the 20\% {CBH} group was significantly greater than that of other treatments. Whole-body crude lipid levels increased with the increase of dietary {CBH}, and was significantly higher in the 20\%, 25\%, and 30\% {CBH} groups than in the control. Hepatosomatic index, condition factor, whole-body moisture, and ash contents were not affected by dietary {CBH} levels. Hepatopancreas soluble protein peaked in shrimp fed 20\% {CBH}, and was significantly greater than in other groups. Hepatopancreas and muscle glycogen showed a similar tendency, but peaked in shrimp fed 15\% {CBH}. Malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities were not affected significantly by dietary {CBH} levels. An ammonia challenge of 96 h showed that the shrimp in the 20\% {CBH} group had the greatest survival rate, although no significant differences were observed among treatments. This study indicates that 15\%–20\% dietary {CBH} is optimal for growth and can improve the ability of L. vannamei to handle stress at low salinities.},

Improved {FCR} coincided with significantly higher (p {\textless} .05) relative energy retention in the dietary {HP} group. In all three trials, the {HP} groups had significantly higher (p {\textless} .05) {TGC} with regard to both {BW} and {CW}. Taken together, the present studies indicate that growth performance and feed utilization in modern salmon farming has the potential to be further improved by increasing the dietary protein-to-lipid ratio. In addition, dietary influence is more precisely assessed when using carcass as the weight denominator when analysing feed utilization and growth performance.},

	abstract = {Trophic subsidies can drive widespread ecological change, thus knowledge of how keystone species respond to subsidies is important. Aquaculture of large carnivorous fish generates substantial waste as faeces and lost feed, providing a food source to mobile benthic invertebrates. We used a controlled feeding study combined with a field survey to better understand the interaction between salmon aquaculture and the sea urchin, Echinus acutus, a dominant mobile invertebrate in Norwegian fjords. We tested if diets affected urchin fatty acid composition by feeding them one of three diet treatments (“aquafeed”, “composite” and “natural”) for 10weeks. To test if proximity to fish farms altered E. acutus fatty acid composition, populations were sampled at 10 locations in Hardangerfjord and Masfjord (Western Norway) from directly adjacent and up to 12km from farms. Fatty acids were measured in gonads and eggs in the diet experiment and in gonads and gut contents from wild animals. Urchins directly assimilated aquaculture waste at farm sites, as evidenced by elevated linoleic acid ({LA}), oleic acid ({OA}) and ∑{LA}, {OA} in their tissues. The diet experiment highlighted the biosynthetic and selective dietary sparing capacity of E. acutus in both gonads and eggs, with evidence for the elongation and desaturation of eicosapentaenoic acid ({EPA}) and arachidonic acid ({ARA}) from C18 fatty acid precursors. Elevated biosynthesis of non-methylene interrupted ({NMI}) fatty acids, in particular 20:3Δ7,11,14 and 20:2 Δ5,11, were also linked to a high C18 fatty acid, low ≥C20 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ({LC}-{PUFA}) diet. Fatty acid composition of gonads of wild urchins indicated a highly variable diet. The study indicates that the generalist feeding ecology of E. acutus, coupled with extensive biosynthetic capacity, enables it to exploit aquaculture waste as an energy-rich trophic subsidy.},

The important economic value of the worm and the increasing demand for feed in shrimp hatcheries have led to an intense exploitation that deplete its population and the sustainability of the whole estuarine ecosystem. The study, which represents the starting point of large-scale production of the polychaete worm by culture in the artificial system, shall be undertaken. Accordingly, a production study using D. pinnaticirris juvenile was carried out under controlled conditions fed with two different feed (feed contains mainly plant protein and animal protein, respectively), and kept in three different substrates (substrate consists of mud and 8.78\%, 37.34\%, 39.17\% sand, respectively). The treatments were arranged according to randomized completely block design in 8 (eight) replicates. The survival rate, body weight increment and growth, oxygen consumption, proximate body chemical, and fatty acid contents were measured. The results showed that growth and oxygen consumption was significantly influenced by a substrate and feed type (P{\textless}0.05). Worms on the mud substrate with 39.17\% sand, and feed containing mainly vegetable protein showed the highest oxygen consumption. Survival rate and chemical body content were not significantly influenced by the type of substrate and feed (P{\textless}0.05). The protein content of the worm was 32.02-43.81\%, while fat content was 2.41-9.89\%. Twenty different fatty acids were identified in the worm of all treatment groups.},

Often, ecological research on macroalgae, seagrasses, and sea wrack requires the conversion of biomass from wet to dry to create consistency across investigations. This process, however, can be destructive, impractical, time consuming, and labour intensive. We collected samples of twelve common Northeastern Pacific Ocean seaweed species (Alaria marginata, Codium fragile, Egregia menziesii, Fucus distichus, Macrocystis pyrifera, Mazzaella spp., Nereocystis luetkeana, Pterygophora californica, Pyropia spp., Ulva spp., and the seagrasses Zostera marina and Phyllospadix spp.) in two states: wet and fresh, or aged and partially desiccated. We weighed, dried, and compared samples, finding that many species displayed a strong (R2 {\textgreater} 0.8) and predictable linear relationship between wet and dried conditions. In contrast, half the aged samples did not have a significant relationship between partially desiccated and dried conditions. Our results provide practical wet weight to dry weight ratios for many species, and with further research, a reliable set of species-specific wet to dry weight ratios for all species could be established. Wet to dry weight ratios are useful for macroalgae, seagrass, and sea wrack research or commercial applications and would reduce the need to conduct extensive wet-dry calibrations in each study.},

The model reproduces the seasonal cycle of pelagic phytoplankton biomass and dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations observed in 2002 and is not excessively sensitive to the parameterization of the key biogeochemical processes of phytoplankton light absorption, zooplankton grazing or denitrification. Simulations indicate that in 2002, 66\% of total nitrogen influx to the region was supplied from marine sources, 20\% from rivers and 14\% from salmon farms operating in the region. Fish farm loads of labile dissolved and particulate nitrogen have greatest impact on water quality in summer and autumn when they supply labile nutrient to seasonally depleted surface waters and fuel additional phytoplankton growth. Bays in the northern part of the region are more vulnerable to farm nutrient enrichment due, in part, to the residual northward circulation. It is estimated that in 2002 12\% of the region had changed from oligotrophic to mesotrophic status due to salmon farm nutrient enrichment. Analysis of a future scenario simulation with 3 fold increase in farm loads quantified the spatial and temporal impact of farms on water quality and indicated that mesotrophic conditions could extend to 54\% of the region. Statistical summaries and visualisation methods were used to communicate model results to stakeholders. Management action has been taken to limit future fish farm loads into the region and implement an environmental monitoring program.},

	abstract = {Water quality in coastal and estuarine systems is dictated by nutrient supply and circulation. However, convoluted coastlines, intermittent river discharge, complex currents, and variable nutrient inputs and transformations, confound interpretation of sparse water quality observations. In high use regions with competing human activities, this system complexity precludes identification of factors causing poor water quality, which can lead to conflict between users. High resolution 3D hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models can simulate the dynamics of a region and demonstrate nutrient pathways in convoluted systems. Here, we use a 3D coupled hydrodynamic, sediment and biogeochemical model to investigate the fine-scale ({\textless}100m; {\textless}1day resolution) nutrient dynamics of temperate coastal waters in southeast Tasmania, Australia. The fate and transport of anthropogenic nutrients between the Huon estuary, the D'Entrecasteaux Channel and the Derwent estuary is of concern and we use the model to explore the regional contribution and connectivity of marine, catchment and anthropogenic nutrient loads. Model skill in the year 2009 is assessed against water quality observations throughout the region and nutrient budgets are evaluated for each sub-region. Results show seasonal variation in estuarine flow with persistent anthropogenic nutrient sources augmenting phytoplankton production, and reducing water quality in summer months. Nutrient-enriched Huon Estuary and D'Entrecasteaux Channel waters are flushed north to the mouth of the Derwent Estuary and then south into the open ocean, with greatest flux in winter. This demonstrates that water quality in the Derwent is not compromised by nutrient influx from the adjacent waters. By using fine-scale 3D biogeochemical models, such as demonstrated here, we can quantify nutrient transport pathways in coastal waters and resolve conflicts between users to support integrated marine management.},

Mean values for total nitrogen and carbon were 7.79±0.85\% and 36.80±4.18\% of the dry weight, respectively. The carbon to calorific equivalent for P. gaudichaudi was 10.37 kcal g-1 carbon (9.13 kcal g-1 when corrected for nitrogen).

This large variation in the calorific content (coefficient of variation of 25.84\%) can be accounted for largely by variation in the ash content (coefficient of variation of 21.84\%). The calorific value determined for P. gaudichaudi is similar to that measured for other carnivorous crustaceans and adds support to the hypothesis that animals with high calorific content have a low fecundity and an energy-rich store which can be used as a buffer during unfavourable periods in their life.},

	abstract = {In 1990, 90\% of the ingredients in Norwegian salmon feed were of marine origin, whereas in 2013 only around 30\%. The contents of fish meal and fish oil in the salmon feed were 18\% and 11\%, respectively, in 2013. Between 2010 and 2013, salmon production in Norway increased by 30\%, but due to a lower inclusion of marine ingredients in the diet, the total amount of marine ingredients used for salmon feed production was reduced from 544,000 to 466,000tonnes. Norwegian salmon farming consumed 1.63milliontonnes of feed ingredients in 2012, containing close to 40 million {GJ} of energy, 580,000tonnes of protein and 530,000tonnes of lipid. 1.26milliontonnes of salmon was produced. Assuming an edible yield of 65\%, 820,000tonnes of salmon fillet, containing 9.44 million {GJ}, and 156,000tonnes of protein were produced. The retentions of protein and energy in the edible product in 2012 were 27\% and 24\%, respectively. Of the 43,000tonnes of {EPA} and {DHA} in the salmon feed in 2012, around 11,000tonnes were retained in the edible part of salmon. The retentions of {EPA} and {DHA} were 46\% in whole salmon and 26\% in fillets, respectively. The fish in/fish out ratio ({FIFO}) measures the amount of fish meal and fish oil that is used to produce one weight equivalent of farmed fish back to wild fish weight equivalents, and the forage fish dependency ratio ({FFDR}) is the amount of wild caught fish used to produce the amount of fish meal and fish oil required to produce 1kg of salmon. From 1990 to 2013, the forage fish dependency ratio for fish meal decreased from 4.4 to 0.7 in Norwegian salmon farming. However, weight-to-weight ratios such as {FIFO} and {FFDR} do not account for the different nutrient contents in the salmon product and in the forage fish used for fish meal and fish oil production. Marine nutrient dependency ratios express the amount of marine oil and protein required to produce 1kg of salmon oil and protein. In 2013, 0.7kg of marine protein was used to produce 1kg of salmon protein, so the Norwegian farmed salmon is thus a net producer of marine protein. Statement of relevance This manuscript shows the retention efficiency of nutrients from feed resources to final product in the Norwegian salmon production, including limiting resources such as the omega-3 fatty acids {EPA} and {DHA} and phosphorous. It is highly relevant to compare the efficiency in commercial scale with experimental data, and this is to our knowledge the first attempt to make such calculations for an entire commercial aquaculture production.},

However, as laboratory and field experiments increase our knowledge of sea lice behaviour under environmental forcing, numerical modelling tools can be used to predict the spread of infectious sea louse larvae from a point source. A three-dimensional numerical model has been developed and recently validated within Loch Torridon, a fjordic sea loch on the west coast of Scotland. Output from the numerical model is used to drive a particle tracking model which follows statistical representations of sea lice through the planktonic stages of a louse life cycle. By including maturation and mortality, the models can be used to predict the dispersion and transport of infectious sea lice from a point source and can be used to produce maps of infectivity under varying environmental conditions. Results highlight the importance of the wind-driven circulation for larval lice transport and suggest that local environmental conditions have considerable impact on the probability of sea lice infection spreading between wild and farmed fish populations.},

	abstract = {Marine protected areas ({MPAs}) are major tools to protect biodiversity and sustain fisheries. For species with a sedentary adult phase and a dispersive larval phase, the effectiveness of {MPA} networks for population persistence depends on connectivity through larval dispersal. However, connectivity patterns between {MPAs} remain largely unknown at large spatial scales. Here, we used a biophysical model to evaluate connectivity between {MPAs} in the Mediterranean Sea, a region of extremely rich biodiversity that is currently protected by a system of approximately a hundred {MPAs}. The model was parameterized according to the dispersal capacity of the dusky grouper Epinephelus marginatus, an archetypal conservation-dependent species, with high economic importance and emblematic in the Mediterranean. Using various connectivity metrics and graph theory, we showed that Mediterranean {MPAs} are far from constituting a true, well-connected network. On average, each {MPA} was directly connected to four others and {MPAs} were clustered into several groups. Two {MPAs} (one in the Balearic Islands and one in Sardinia) emerged as crucial nodes for ensuring multi-generational connectivity. The high heterogeneity of {MPA} distribution, with low density in the South-Eastern Mediterranean, coupled with a mean dispersal distance of 120 km, leaves about 20\% of the continental shelf without any larval supply. This low connectivity, here demonstrated for a major Mediterranean species, poses new challenges for the creation of a future Mediterranean network of well-connected {MPAs} providing recruitment to the whole continental shelf. This issue is even more critical given that the expected reduction of pelagic larval duration following sea temperature rise will likely decrease connectivity even more.},

	abstract = {The data is the percent algal cover derived from underwater visual census methods involving transect counts at rocky reef sites around Tasmania. This data forms part of a larger dataset that also surveyed fish and megafaunal invertebrate abundance for the area. The aggregated dataset allows examination of changes in Tasmanian shallow reef floral and faunal communities over a decadal scale - initial surveys were conducted in 1992-1995, and again at the same sites in 2006-2007. There are plans for ongoing surveys. An additional component was added in the latter study - a boat ramp study looking at the proximity of boat ramps and their effects of fishing. We analysed underwater visual census data on fishes and acroinvertebrates (abalone and rock lobsters) at 133 shallow rocky reef sites around Tasmania that ranged from 0.6 - 131 km from the nearest boat ramp. These sites were not all the same as those used for the comparison of 1994 and 2006 reef communities. The subset of 133 sites examined in this component consisted of only those sites that were characterized by the two major algal (kelp) types (laminarian or fucoid dominated). Sites with atypical algal assemblages were omitted from the 196 sites surveyed in 2006. This study aimed to examine reef community data for changes at the community level, changes in species richness and introduced species populations, and changes that may have resulted from ocean warming and fishing.
The methods are described in detail in Edgar and Barrett (1997). Primarily the data are derived from transects at 5 m depth and/or 10 m depth at each site surveyed. The underwater visual census ({UVC}) methodology used to survey rocky reef communities was designed to maximise detection of (i) changes in population numbers and size-structure (ii) cascading ecosystem effects associated with disturbances such as fishing, (iii) long term change and variability in reef assemblages.},

	abstract = {Kelp forests provide essential habitats for organisms in temperate rocky shores. Loss of kelp forests has occurred over large areas in a number of temperate regions, including in Australia, where the dominant kelp Ecklonia radiata has been lost from substantial areas of the shoreline. Loss of E. radiata has been associated with environmental stressors, including increased temperature and anthropogenic contaminants, as well as biological factors, such as herbivory. Disease may also play a role, but there is little information on the role of disease in the loss of kelp from coastal ecosystems or on the potential role of pathogenic microorganisms, such as viruses. E. radiata across much of its distribution in Australia can develop a "bleached" phenotype, which may be a disease. To investigate whether the phenotype was associated with a potential viral agent, we shotgun sequenced viral particles that were isolated from kelp with normal (healthy) and bleached phenotypes. Each virome consisted of {\textasciitilde}380,000 reads, of which {\textasciitilde}25\% were similar to known viruses. All samples were dominated by bacteriophages, but novel {ssDNA} virus sequences were detected that were almost exclusively in viromes from the bleached kelp phenotype. These {ssDNA} viruses are covered by 11 contigs that contained complete capsids and characteristic rep genes that were 30-60\% similar to those of circular, Rep-encoding {ssDNA} viruses ({CRESS}-{DNA} viruses). {CRESS}-{DNA} viruses have not previously been described from macroalgae, and the rep genes were similar to {CRESS}-{DNA} viruses from marine water samples, snails, crabs, anemones, but also dragonflies. This raises the interesting possibility that the kelp could be a vector of the {CRESS}-{DNA} viruses to other organisms that are associated with the bleached state.},

Fish assemblages were visually investigated using a belt transect method and the line-intercept technique was used to examine the substrate composition. 101 species of fish belonging to 31 families were recorded. Algal farming affected the associated fish fauna in terms of abundance, species richness, trophic identity and fish community composition. However, the impact differed between the lagoons. Algal farms in one lagoon hosted a more abundant and diversified fish fauna than controls, whereas farms in the other lagoon exhibited lower fish densities and similar species diversity compared to controls. The discrepancies between lagoons may be an effect of differences in farming intensity and character of the substratum. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

              in seawater and the horizontal transmission from infected to non-infected fish; however, the extent of waterborne transmission between farms has not been quantified. In this study, we used a stochastic hydrodynamic connectivity-based disease spread model to determine the role of hydrodynamic connectivity and the effect of seawater temperature and salinity on the dynamics of piscirickettsiosis in the Los Lagos region of Chile. Results demonstrate that environmental dynamics play a major role in disease prevalence. The strongest determinants of piscirickettsiosis prevalence were the number of infected farms in upstream waters and the extent of disease outbreaks in upstream waters (total mortality), followed by seawater salinity and temperature. In farms downstream from infected farms, observed disease prevalence 25 wk into the farming cycle was close to 100\%, while in farms with little or no exposure to upstream, infected farms, prevalence reached only {\textasciitilde}10\% by the end of the farming cycle (Week 56). No previous studies have quantified the scales of connectivity associated with piscirickettsiosis or provided risk metrics of waterborne transmission of the disease among farms; these are a novel aspect of this research. The above knowledge regarding the use of the epidemiological model will allow industry and regulators to better target disease control strategies for more effective control of piscirickettsiosis in the study area.},

	abstract = {Each year a significant proportion of global food production is lost to pests and diseases, with concerted efforts by government and industry focussed on application of effective biosecurity policies which attempt to minimise their emergence and spread. In aquaculture the volume of seaweeds produced is second only to farmed fish and red algal carrageenophytes currently represent approximately 42\% of global production of all seaweeds. Despite this importance, expansion of the seaweed sector is increasingly limited by the high prevalence of recalcitrant diseases and epiphytic pests with potential to emerge and with the demonstrated propensity to spread, particularly in the absence of effective national and international biosecurity policies. Developing biosecurity policy and legislation to manage biosecurity risk in seaweed aquaculture is urgently required to limit these impacts. To understand current international biosecurity frameworks and their efficacy, existing legislative frameworks were analysed quantitatively for the content of biosecurity measures, applicability to the seaweed industry, and inclusion of risks posed by diseases, pests and non-native species. Deficiencies in existing frameworks included the following: inconsistent terminology for inclusion of cultivated seaweeds, unclear designation of implementation responsibility, insufficient evidence-based information and limited alignment of biosecurity hazards and risks. Given the global importance of the cultivation of various seaweeds in alleviating poverty in low and middle income countries, it is crucial that the relatively low-unit value of the industry (i.e. as compared with other aquatic animal sectors) should not conflate with a perceived low risk of disease or pest transfer, nor the subsequent economic and environmental impact that disease transfer may impact on receiving nations (well beyond their seaweed operations). Developing a clear basis for development of robust international biosecurity policies related to the trade in seaweeds arising from the global aquaculture industry, by first addressing the gaps highlighted in this study, will be crucial in limiting impacts of pests and diseases on this valuable industry and on natural capital in locations where seaweeds are farmed.},

	abstract = {The global extent of macroalgal forests is declining, greatly affecting marine biodiversity at broad scales through the effects macroalgae have on ecosystem processes, habitat provision, and food web support. Networks of marine protected areas comprise one potential tool that may safeguard gene flow among macroalgal populations in the face of increasing population fragmentation caused by pollution, habitat modification, climate change, algal harvesting, trophic cascades, and other anthropogenic stressors. Optimal design of protected area networks requires knowledge of effective dispersal distances for a range of macroalgae. We conducted a global meta-analysis based on data in the published literature to determine the generality of relation between genetic differentiation and geographic distance among macroalgal populations. We also examined whether spatial genetic variation differed significantly with respect to higher taxon, life history, and habitat characteristics. We found clear evidence of population isolation by distance across a multitude of macroalgal species. Genetic and geographic distance were positively correlated across 49 studies; a modal distance of 50-100 km maintained F-{ST} {\textless} 0.2. This relation was consistent for all algal divisions, life cycles, habitats, and molecular marker classes investigated. Incorporating knowledge of the spatial scales of gene flow into the design of marine protected area networks will help moderate anthropogenic increases in population isolation and inbreeding and contribute to the resilience of macroalgal forests. Implicaciones del Aislamiento por Distancia de Macroalgas para Redes de areas Marinas Protegidas Resumen La extension global de los bosques de macroalgas esta declinando, afectando significativamente a la biodiversidad marina en escalas amplias a traves de la influencia que las macroalgas tienen sobre los procesos ecosistemicos, provision de habitats y soporte de las redes alimentarias. Las redes de areas marinas protegidas son una herramienta potencial que puede asegurar el flujo genico entre poblaciones de macroalgas frente a la creciente fragmentacion poblacional causada por la contaminacion, la modificacion del habitat, el cambio climatico, la cosecha de algas, las cascadas troficas y otros estresantes antropogenicos. El diseno optimo de una red de areas protegidas requiere del conocimiento efectivo de las distancias de dispersion para un area de macroalgas. Llevamos a cabo un meta-analisis global basado en datos publicados en la literatura para determinar la generalidad de la relacion entre la diferenciacion genetica y la distancia geografica entre poblaciones de macroalgas. Tambien examinamos si la variacion genetica espacial difiere significativamente con respecto a taxones mas altos, historia de vida y caracteristicas de habitat. Encontramos evidencia clara del aislamiento de las poblaciones por la distancia a lo largo de una multitud de especies de macroalgas. La distancia genetica y geografica estuvo correlacionada positivamente en 49 estudios: una distancia modal de 50-100 km mantuvo una F-{ST} {\textless} 0.2. Esta relacion fue constante para todas las divisiones, ciclos de vida, habitats y marcadores moleculares de las algas investigadas.

	abstract = {Weights and directionality of the edges carry a large part of the information we can extract from a complex network. However, many measures were formulated initially for undirected binary networks. The necessity to incorporate information about the weights led to the conception of the multiple extensions, particularly for definitions of the local clustering coefficient discussed here. We uncover that not all of these extensions are fully-weighted; some depend on the degree and thus change a lot when an infinitely small weight edge is exchanged for the absence of an edge, a feature that is not always desirable. We call these methods "hybrid" and argue that, in many situations, one should prefer fully-weighted definitions. After listing the necessary requirements for a method to analyze many various weighted networks properly, we propose a fully-weighted continuous clustering coefficient that satisfies all the previously proposed criteria while also being continuous with respect to vanishing weights. We demonstrate that the behavior and meaning of the Zhang--Horvath clustering and our new continuous definition provide complementary results and significantly outperform other definitions in multiple relevant conditions.},

	abstract = {Offshore aquaculture is the subject of intense debate, focusing on feasibility, sustainability, and the potential for effective expansion in the context of competing uses of the coastal zone, and a world requirement for an additional thirty million tonnes of aquatic products by 2050.A modelling framework that integrates the {SWAT} model for the watershed, Delft3D for ocean circulation, and the {EcoWin} model for long-term (10year) ecological simulations, was developed for integrated analysis of catchment, inshore waters, and offshore aquaculture, providing an approach that addresses production, environmental effects, and disease interactions. This framework was tested using a case study in {SE} Portugal, for a system-scale modelling domain with an ocean area of 470km2 and a coastal watershed area of 627km2.This domain contains an inshore area of 184km2 (Ria Formosa) subject to multiple (often conflicting) uses, including aquaculture of the high value (farmgate price{\textgreater}10€kg-1) clam Tapes decussatus, and one of the first offshore aquaculture parks in the world, located at distance of 3.6nm from the coast, at a water depth of 30-60m, with an area of 15km2. The park contains 60 leases, of which at most 70\% are for finfish cage culture, and at least 30\% for bivalve longline culture.A substantial part of the dissolved nutrients required to drive primary production that constitutes the food source for clams originates from the coastal catchment. Although stakeholder perception is that nutrients are mainly linked to point-source discharges from wastewater treatment plants, watershed modelling indicates that 55\% of the nitrogen and 70\% of the phosphorus loads are from diffuse sources.The residence time of waters in the inshore area is low (1-2. days), and consequently pelagic primary production takes place offshore, and drives inshore clam production. The longline culture of Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) in the offshore park reduces inshore food availability for clams: simulations suggest that a 3\% decrease in clam yields will occur due to offshore mussel cultivation, at a cost of 1.2. million. €. This is offset by revenue from offshore culture, but is a source of stakeholder conflict.Potential disease spread between the offshore and inshore systems was analysed using a particle tracking model, and allowed the development of a risk exposure map. This illustrates the challenges posed by hydrodynamic connectivity with respect to biosecurity of aquaculture and fisheries, both inshore and offshore.The model framework was also used for optimisation of stocking density, and analysis of combined culture of finfish and shellfish, both in terms of production and environmental effects. In the offshore aquaculture park, the models suggest that integrated multi-trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) of gilthead bream (Sparus aurata) and Mediterranean mussels allows for an increased harvestable biomass of mussels, particularly at higher stocking densities, and offsets some of the negative externalities of finfish culture.By quantifying issues such as reduced yields for inshore stakeholders due to offshore activity, and illustrating the need for strong governance to offset disease risks, dynamic models make a valuable contribution in assessing the feasibility of offshore aquaculture, and the general principles that should underpin licensing and regulation of this sector.We stress the need to go beyond the conventional spatial planning toolset in order to ensure an ecosystem approach to aquaculture, and the opportunities that exist for applying a systems framework in an information economy, where the capital costs of software and data have been sharply reduced. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Numerical particles released from infected farm fish in accordance with {IHNV} shedding rates estimated through laboratory experiments are dispersed by model oceanic flows. Viral particles are inactivated by ambient {UV} radiation levels and by the natural microbial community at rates derived through laboratory studies. Viral concentration maps showing temporal and spatial changes are produced and combined with lab-determined minimum infectious dosages to estimate the infective connectivity among farms. Results demonstrate that neighbouring naïve farms can become exposed to {IHNV} via water-borne transport from an {IHNV} diseased farm, with a higher risk in April than July, and that many events in the sequence of farm outbreaks in 2001-2002 are consistent with higher risks in our farm connectivity matrix.

	abstract = {A 3D ecosystem model was used to quantify changes in water quality brought about by salmon aquaculture in the D'Entrecasteaux Channel and Huon Estuary in southeast Tasmania. Macroalgae-based integrated multi- trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) was simulated and showed that {IMTA} is capable of reducing the increased chlor- ophyll concentration attributable to fish farming by up to 10–15\% in large areas of the region, during the season of highest production. Kelp farms (Macrocystis pyrifera) recovered between 6 and 11\% of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen ({DIN}) input by salmon aquaculture over a nine month period, with {DIN} remediation increasing linearly with farm size. Under a ten-fold increase in aquaculture to very high loads, a much lower remediation effect was found for both chlorophyll and {DIN}. Model results indicate that {IMTA} could have an important impact on reducing negative effects of finfish aquaculture on water quality providing that stocking rates are not too high.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional primitive-equation hydrodynamic model was applied to the Huon Estuary and D'Entrecasteaux Channel in south-eastern Tasmania to characterise the physical oceanography of the coupled system. Model results verify that the Huon Estuary behaves as a salt-wedge estuary, and can be considered the driver for residual circulation for the system; the bottom water enters the southern channel and is directed up-estuary in the form of a salt wedge, to be entrained into the surface layer along its length, whereas freshwater downstream flow is returned to the channel. The D'Entrecasteaux Channel behaves as a {ROFI} (Regions of Freshwater Influence) regime, where buoyancy owing to the freshwater inflow stabilises the water column, in competition with mixing processes. The {ROFI} is influenced by rotation, resulting in a flow predominantly directed northward in the channel, with only a small percentage exiting the southern boundary under the influence of northerly winds. The connectivity of the region is largely influenced by the residual circulation, where the northern channel exhibits poor connectivity with the rest of the system, whereas the southern channel and Huon are relatively well connected throughout. Flushing analysis and particle tracking show the flushing time for the whole region to be ∼20–26 days.},

	abstract = {Microvariant genotypes of Ostried herpesvirus-1 ({OsHV}-1 μVar) have recently emerged as a cause of epizootic mortality in Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) in many countries. Measures that can reduce the spread of the virus are required to decrease the incidence and distribution of the disease at the local and global scales. Disease management strategies and biosecurity plans require data describing the stability of {OsHV}-1 in the environment and the methods required for effective disinfection of the virus. A bioassay using intramuscular injection of 10month old oyster spat had a limit of detection of 3.6×103 copies of {OsHV}-1 genome per oyster. This was 10-fold more sensitive compared to immersion challenge of 5month old spat, even though the oysters were exposed to a greater volume of inoculum over a period of 2h. {OsHV}-1 remained infectious in seawater for 2days at 20°C and in wet or dry, non-living oyster tissues for at least 7days at 20°C. {OsHV}-1 was inactivated by: commercial multipurpose disinfectants used according to label directions (Virkon-S, Dupont; quaternary ammonium preparation, Livingston); sodium hydroxide (20g/L 10min), iodine (0.1\% 5min) and formalin (10\% v/v 30min); and physical measures including heating to 50°C for 5min and exposure to a high dose of ultraviolet light. Ineffective disinfectant treatments were: heating to 42°C for 5min, and alkaline detergent (2000ppm, 10min) (Pyroneg, Johnson Diversey). Sodium hypochlorite (50ppm available chlorine, 15min) inactivated {OsHV}-1 in relatively clean seawater, but this treatment was not effective after addition of protein, 10\% v/v foetal bovine serum. A concentration of 200ppm available chlorine for 15min did not inactivate {OsHV}-1 in oyster tissue. This study provides information that will assist in modelling the disease risk posed by {OsHV}-1 and data that are necessary to devise effective biosecurity strategies to control the spread of {OsHV}-1 in a variety of situations. The potential role of fomites in the spread of the virus, and recurrence of disease in endemically infected areas were highlighted by the persistence of infectivity in non-living oyster tissues.
Statement of relevance
Data on the duration of infectivity and effective disinfection of {OsHV}-1 in filed relevant preparations is needed for improved disease control.},

	abstract = {Australia’s iconic Great Barrier Reef ({GBR}) continues to suffer from repeated impacts of cyclones, coral bleaching, and outbreaks of the coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish ({COTS}), losing much of its coral cover in the process. This raises the question of the ecosystem’s systemic resilience and its ability to rebound after large-scale population loss. Here, we reveal that around 100 reefs of the {GBR}, or around 3\%, have the ideal properties to facilitate recovery of disturbed areas, thereby imparting a level of systemic resilience and aiding its continued recovery. These reefs (1) are highly connected by ocean currents to the wider reef network, (2) have a relatively low risk of exposure to disturbances so that they are likely to provide replenishment when other reefs are depleted, and (3) have an ability to promote recovery of desirable species but are unlikely to either experience or spread {COTS} outbreaks. The great replenishment potential of these ‘robust source reefs’, which may supply 47\% of the ecosystem in a single dispersal event, emerges from the interaction between oceanographic conditions and geographic location, a process that is likely to be repeated in other reef systems. Such natural resilience of reef systems will become increasingly important as the frequency of disturbances accelerates under climate change.},

	abstract = {Networks are ubiquitous in natural, technological and social systems. They are of increasing relevance for improved understanding and control of infectious diseases of plants, animals and humans, given the interconnectedness of today's world. Recent modelling work on disease development in complex networks shows: the relative rapidity of pathogen spread in scale-free compared with random networks, unless there is high local clustering; the theoretical absence of an epidemic threshold in scale-free networks of infinite size, which implies that diseases with low infection rates can spread in them, but the emergence of a threshold when realistic features are added to networks (e.g. finite size, household structure or deactivation of links); and the influence on epidemic dynamics of asymmetrical interactions. Models suggest that control of pathogens spreading in scale-free networks should focus on highly connected individuals rather than on mass random immunization. A growing number of empirical applications of network theory in human medicine and animal disease ecology confirm the potential of the approach, and suggest that network thinking could also benefit plant epidemiology and forest pathology, particularly in human-modified pathosystems linked by commercial transport of plant and disease propagules. Potential consequences for the study and management of plant and tree diseases are discussed.},

	abstract = {Several lines of evidence show that ocean warming off the east coast of Tasmania is the result of intensification of the East Australian Current ({EAC}). Increases in the strength, duration and frequency of southward incursions of warm, nutrient poor {EAC} water transports heat and biota to eastern Tasmania. This shift in large-scale oceanography is reflected by changes in the structure of nearshore zooplankton communities and other elements of the pelagic system; by a regional decline in the extent of dense beds of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera); by marked changes in the distribution of nearshore fishes; and by range expansions of other northern warmer-water species to colonize Tasmanian coastal waters. Population-level changes in commercially important invertebrate species may also be associated with the warming trend.Over-grazing of seaweed beds by one recently established species, the sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii, is causing a fundamental shift in the structure and dynamics of Tasmanian rocky reef systems by the formation of sea urchin 'barrens' habitat. Formation of barrens represents an interaction between effects of climate change and a reduction in large predatory rock lobsters due to fishing. Barrens realize a loss of biodiversity and production from rocky reefs, and threaten valuable abalone and rock lobster fisheries and the local economies and social communities they support. This range-extending sea urchin species represents the single largest biologically mediated threat to the integrity of important shallow water rocky reef communities in eastern Tasmania.In synthesizing change in the physical ocean climate in eastern Tasmania and parallel shifts in species' distributions and ecological processes, there is evidence that the direct effects of changing physical conditions have precipitated cascading effects of ecological change in benthic (rocky reef) and pelagic systems. However, some patterns correlated with temperature have plausible alternative explanations unrelated to thermal gradients in time or space. We identify important knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to adequately understand, anticipate and adapt to future climate-driven changes in marine systems in the region. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Many aspects of such polyculture systems have been described, but little attention has been given to the impact of live seaweeds on the microbiological properties of the water that connects the algae and animals. In this investigation, the Pacific red alga Gracilaria textorii was cultured in a recirculated dual tank system (150 L) with the juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai. Dynamic changes of total bacteria ({TB}) and total Vibrio ({TV}) in the water of polyculture and monoculture systems were evaluated. Results revealed that (1) level of {TB} in the polyculture was constantly higher than in the monoculture over a 6.5-day period. While levels of {TV} in the polyculture was detected to be constantly lower than in the monoculture, (2) integration of G. textorii in the abalone culture changed the Vibrio compositions in the water as judged by the changes of bacteria colony types; (3) application of artificial diet led to dramatic increase of the levels in {TB} and {TV} in both systems at 12 h after application in the 24-h test and resulted in selective propagation of Vibrio in the water in the monoculture system; (4) polyculture of G. textorii with juvenile abalone in combination with feeding with live algal diet helped to maintain low levels of {TV} and the balance of the Vibrio composition; (5) living biomass of G. textorii was effective in preventing propagation of two purified Vibrio strains (V alginolaticus and V logei) in the water. These results provide a general basis of the dynamic changes of levels in {TB} and {TV} in a seaweed-abalone polyculture system with or without artificial diet in tanks.

However, the accuracy and utility of {SDMs} can be compromised when predictor variables are selected without careful consideration of their ecophysiological relevance to the focal organism. We conducted an in-depth examination of the variable selection process by evaluating predictors to be used in {SDMs} for Membranipora membranacea, an ecologically significant marine invasive species with a complex lifecycle, as a case study. Using an information-theoretic and multi-model inference approach based on generalized linear mixed models, we assessed multiple environmental variables (depth, kelp density, kelp substrate, temperature, and wave exposure) as predictors of the abundance of multiple life stages of M. membranacea, investigating species-environment relationships and relative and absolute variable importance. We found that the relative importance of a predictor, the metric calculated to represent a predictor, and whether a predictor was proximal or distal were important considerations in the variable selection process. Data constraints (e.g. sample size, characteristics of available predictor data) may inhibit accurate assessment of predictor variables during variable selection. Importantly, our results suggest that species-environment relationships derived from small-scale studies can inform variable selection for {SDMs} at larger spatiotemporal scales. We developed a conceptual framework for variable selection for {SDMs} which can be applied to most contexts of species distribution modelling, but particularly those with several candidate predictors and a large dataset.},

The use of molecular markers in the theoretical framework of population genetics has allowed great advances in this field, but the prime question of quantifying the role of each population in the system remains unresolved. Furthermore, the use and interpretation of classical methods are still bounded by the need for a priori information and underlying assumptions that are seldom respected in natural systems. Network theory was applied to map the genetic structure in a metapopulation system by using microsatellite data from populations of a threatened seagrass, Posidonia oceanica, across its whole geographical range. The network approach, free from a priori assumptions and from the usual underlying hypotheses required for the interpretation of classical analyses, allows both the straightforward characterization of hierarchical population structure and the detection of populations acting as hubs critical for relaying gene flow or sustaining the metapopulation system. This development opens perspectives in ecology and evolution in general, particularly in areas such as conservation biology and epidemiology, where targeting specific populations is crucial.},

A hydrodynamic model is coupled with a biological particle-tracking model, with characteristics of plankton sea lice. Simulations are undertaken for May and October 2011–2013, forced by local wind data collected for those periods. Particles are continually released from positions representing farm locations, weighted by relative farm counts, over a 2-week period and tracked for a further 5 days. A comparison is made between modelled relative concentrations against physical and biological surveys to provide confidence in model outputs. Connectivity between farm locations is determined in order to propose potential coordination areas. Generally, connectivity depends on flow patterns in the loch and decreases with increased farm separation. The connectivity indices are used to estimate the origins of the sea lice population composition at each site, which may influence medicinal regimens to avoid loss of efficacy.},

	abstract = {Scotland is the largest Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) producer in the {EU} with an output of over 150,000t, contributing over £500 million annually towards the economy. Production continues to increase, predominantly due to the increase in output per farm and reduction in losses due to infectious diseases. Farms are grouped within disease management areas whose boundaries are defined by where the closest pair of farms is separated by more than twice the tidal excursion distance ({TE}) Tidal excursion is defined as 7.2km in mainland Scotland, or 3.6km in the Shetland Islands). The majority of salmon farms are located within relatively sheltered inshore areas where non-tidal advective current speed is minimal. However there is an aspiration for offshore production where it might be possible to increase stocking levels and where current speeds will be greater so {TE} models could break down. Separation distances whereby farms would avoid infection risk were obtained using an analytical, discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered ({SEIR}) model coupled with a hydrodynamic transport expression representing transmission of pathogenic agents between fish farms. The model incorporated transmission, expression and recovery parameters as well as pathogen shedding and decay. The simplified hydrodynamic model incorporated residual advection, tidal advection and turbulent diffusion elements. The obtained separation distances were compared to a computationally intensive, numerical model and were demonstrated to be comparable, although the analytical model underestimated the variation within the transmission distances. Applying characteristics for a robust pathogen, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus type ({IPNV}-type), and less robust pathogens such as infectious salmon anaemia virus type ({ISAV}-type) and Aeromonas salmonicida type ({AS}-type) pathogens, it was possible to obtain separation distances whereby farms avoided infection. Simulation outputs indicated that separation distances should increase to avoid disease as farm size and current speed increase. The more conserved {IPNV}-type pathogen required separation distances of hundreds of kilometres, {AS}-type required tens of kilometres, whilst the distances for {ISAV}-type were within the scale of the current {DMAs}, that were developed for {ISAV} control. However, should production be moved to areas of faster moving currents and increased farm production the current disease management area principles might need readdressing.},

	abstract = {Global aquaculture production continues to increase across a variety of sectors, including Atlantic salmon production in Scotland. One limitation to the expansion of open-cage aquaculture is disease-induced stock losses as well as the potential for disease agents from farms interacting with other farms and possibly with wild salmonids. Epidemiological studies of disease-agent transmission often omit environmental transmission of organisms, although this process is an integral part of parasite spread and incidence. Within the aquatic environment, water movements enable pathogens and parasites to potentially be transmitted over long distances. As pathogens and parasites are transported, their status can change; they can degrade or, in the case of sea lice, develop into an infectious stage. A combination of biological and physical models is required to understand the transmission of disease-causing organisms. Here we propose a set of components that have been implemented in a range of modelling studies of sea lice dispersal, and describe how such attributes have been used in developing a study in one of Scotland’s largest fjordic systems. By developing descriptive simulation model frameworks, which are validated using physical and biological observations, alternative methods of integrated pest management can be investigated and developed. The identification of dispersal routes of sea lice and establishment of potential farm-farm connections can inform sea lice management.},

We tested whether introducing no-farming areas or 'firebreaks' could disconnect dispersal networks of a parasitic disease affecting the world's largest marine fish farming industry (∼1000 farms). Larval salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) are released from and transported among salmon farms by ocean currents, creating inter-farm networks of louse dispersal. We used a state-of-the-art biophysical model to predict louse movement along the Norwegian coastline and network analysis to identify firebreaks to dispersal. At least one firebreak that fragmented the network into two large unconnected groups of farms was identified for all seasons. During spring, when wild salmon migrate out into the ocean, and louse levels per fish at farms must be minimised, two effective firebreaks were created by removing 13 and 21 farms (1.3\% and 2.2\% of all farms in the system) at ∼61°N and 67°N, respectively. We have demonstrated that dispersal models coupled with network analysis can identify no-farming zones that fragment dispersal networks. Reduced dispersal pathways should lower infection pressure at farms, slow the evolution of resistance to parasite control measures, and alleviate infection pressure on wild salmon populations.},

	abstract = {Through field observations and a compilation of several manipulative and mensurative experiments carried out in freshwater and marine ecosystems in southern Chile, we here provide alternatives for using natural ecosystem services to diminish salmonfarming ecological footprints. In freshwater lakes, where early stages of salmon growth are completed, the high filter-feeding rate of the native bivalve, Diplodon chilensis, can significantly reduce the effect of salmon farming by maintaining oligotrophic conditions. The constant movements of D. chilensis on the bottom sediment substrate generate enough bioturbation to reduce the impact of nutrient accumulation (nitrogen and phosphorus) due to salmon farming. We documented a similar mitigating effect in marine mussel (Aulacomya ater) beds, on rocky substrates in the channels and fjords where salmon are grown in pens. There is an additional benefit in such cases because A. ater is a valuable commercial resource. Artificial reefs, both in lakes and the inner sea, provide refuges for crustaceans and fish. In particular, these artificial structures enhance juvenile recruitment of invertebrates and fish. In freshwater ecosystems, native endemic crustaceans (crabs [Aegla sp.] and crayfish [Samastacus spinifrons]) are capable of processing excess food deposited on the bottom from salmon pens. Marine crabs (Cancer edwardsi) perform a similar ecological role under salmon pens in the inner sea. In summary, artificial reefs provide a way to link salmon farming with bottom heterogeneity and thus reduce the impacts of the salmon farms by facilitating the incorporation of organic matter into benthic productivity. Excess food is utilized around salmon-farm pens by both native fish and escaped salmon. These fishes, in turn, are prime targets for sport fishing, which, if managed in an appropriate way, could become an effective way to remove assimilated nutrients and organic matter via the removal of fish, which are at the top of the food web. This practice would have the additional benefit of removing salmon that have escaped from culture pens, particularly if the fishery was conducted around the pens.},

	abstract = {The Global Aquaculture industry is the fastest growing food production sector. Owing to this expansion, the industry is facing a range of challenges resulting in a call for more sustainable solutions. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}), a practice combining the culture of fed aquaculture fish with organic and inorganic extractive species, appears as an appropriate answer, able to help social, economical and environmental dimensions to work together. This study has two major purposes: to highlight changes in ecosystem services provision when adding seaweeds to a salmon farm and to investigate their economic value by suggesting adequate valuation methods. This research was conducted on a study site located in an open fjord of Northern Norway (67°04’238’’N 14°05’076’’E). Data were collected through stakeholder consultation and with the investigation of related literature and databases. Additional value in terms of cultural (e.g. recreation and education), provisioning (e.g. increased biodiversity) and regulating services (i.e. healthy climate and clean water) were studied. The results revealed that adding seaweeds besides a salmon farm brings many positive changes in ecosystem services provision hence potential to the economy. Consequently, environmental valuation techniques were explored to support the findings of the study and outline the numerous benefits to society. Nonetheless, the negative effect of noisy seaweeds harvesting operations was point out. In conclusion, the thesis argues that appending seaweeds to a salmon farm brings much social and environmental value. Moreover, it deals with the current challenges faced by the global aquaculture sector and guides it towards a more sustainable and socially acceptable industry. Even though this research has also identified considerable value, legal issues, educational challenges and market concerns will represent future decisive topics when taking {IMTA} to a commercial stage.},

Virus survival, infection pressure and contact networks among farms influence the potential of {PD} to spread.

In this study, we included all records of {PD} by subtype 3 ({SPDV}3) in the study population from the first reported in August 2006 to the last reported in November 2009. Using logistic regression analyses, we found that contact network by water transport explained better transmission of {PD} than contact networks defined by ownership or close distance to infected farms. Hydrodynamic modelling can be a valuable tool to forecast the spread of {PD} and thereby take actions to reduce the transmission. Knowing the risk of getting infected, it is important to avoid water transport from infected farms when new cohorts are transferred to sea water, and to have conscious control regarding management operations between farms.},

	abstract = {The dispersal of individuals among marine populations is of great importance to metapopulation dynamics, population persistence, and species expansion. Understanding this connectivity between distant populations is key to their effective conservation and management. For many marine species, population connectivity is determined largely by ocean currents transporting larvae and juveniles between distant patches of suitable habitat. Recent work has focused on the biophysics of marine larval dispersal and its importance to population dynamics, although few studies have evaluated the spatial and temporal patterns of this potential dispersal. Here, we show how an Eulerian advection–diffusion approach can be used to model the dispersal of coral larvae between reefs throughout the Tropical Pacific. We illustrate how this connectivity can be analyzed using graph theory—an effective approach for exploring patterns in spatial connections, as well as for determining the importance of each site and pathway to local and regional connectivity. Results indicate that the scale (average distance) of dispersal in the Pacific is on the order of 50–150 km, consistent with recent studies in the Caribbean (Cowen, et al. 2006). Patterns in the dispersal graphs highlight pathways for larval dispersal along major ocean currents and through island chains. A series of critical island ‘stepping stones’ are discovered providing potential pathways across the equatorial currents and connecting distant island groups. Patterns in these dispersal graphs highlight possible pathways for species expansions, reveal connected upstream/downstream populations, and suggest areas that might be prioritized for marine conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Pancreas disease ({PD}) is an emerging disease in salmon farming caused by the salmonid alphavirus ({SAV}). {SAV} is evidently spread horizontally between neighbouring salmon farms, but whether such transmission occurs by passive drift in the water current or via fomites is not known. We tested whether hydrodynamic modelling contributes to explain the spread of {PD}, in which case {SAV} is likely to spread by passive drift. We present a simple logistic regression model that accounts for the effect of {PD} in the neighbourhood on the probability of acquiring {PD} in cohorts of farmed salmonids from an area on the west coast of Norway between 2005 and 2008. For a given cohort, we calculated infection pressure ({IP}) based on Euclidean distance, seaway distance or estimated water contact to sites with {PD}, and compared the amount of variance explained in the regression model by the different variants of {IP}. Water contact between a discharging farm site and a receiving site was calculated by simulating particle discharge using a hydrodynamic model. {IP} estimated by water contact was the best predictor of {PD} cases and controls in the model, which performed significantly better than {IP} estimated by seaway distance or Euclidean distance. Since the spread of {PD} in the study area was best explained by modelled water velocity, we conclude that {PD} is likely to be spread by passive drift of {SAV} in the water current.},

Obser- vations of seaweed farms suggest that they may act as a habitat for associated species, potentially altering the richness of the local area. Previous studies have generally focused on species associ- ated with wild kelps, showing the holdfast to be relatively species-rich. Little research has, how- ever, been conducted on the species associated with cultivated kelps. The habitat created by cul- tivated kelp holdfasts may act as a novel habitat and not simply an expansion of existing kelp habitat, due to differences in holdfast age, holdfast morphology and holdfast position in the water column. Laminaria digitata from the west of Ireland were examined to test if these differences result in the fauna of cultivated (suspended) holdfasts being distinct from wild (benthic) stands. To place the results in a broader context, patterns were compared to holdfast−richness relationships observed in comparable studies from the {NE} Atlantic. Total abundance of holdfast epifauna was similar across benthic and suspended holdfasts from the west of Ireland, although species richness was higher in suspended samples. Richness and abundance in suspended kelp holdfasts were consistent with the range of values recorded in other wild kelp studies. There were significant dif- ferences in assemblage composition between holdfast types ({ANOSIM}; R = 0.383, p {\textless} 0.05). The distributions of faunal feeding types did not, however, vary between suspended and benthic kelps. Suspended holdfasts in the west of Ireland represented a novel habitat with higher species richness and a different species assemblage when compared to adjacent benthic kelps.},

The growth, the C and N content, and the nitrogen isotope ratios (δ15N) of S. latissima were monitored over 1 year. The {DIN} concentrations in seawater were higher at the salmon farm stations than at the reference station during the winter, and the N/P ratio at the salmon farm stations was higher from September to January and in June. S. latissima at the salmon farm stations grew faster than at the reference station. The length of S. latissima increased by 50 \% when integrated with the salmon farm compared to the reference station. The N content of S. latissima was positively correlated to the {DIN} concentration in seawater (p {\textless} 0.05), but the increased N supply from salmon did not result in N accumulation in S. latissima at the salmon farm station because of the dilution by a higher growth rate. The δ15N in S. latissima was higher at the salmon farm station from April to June and changed in the direction of the δ15N signature in urine. This indicated that N in S. latissima at the salmon farm station partly originated from the salmon. One hectare of S. latissima may absorb 0.8{\textasciitilde}1.2 t N during one growth season. Large-scale cultivation of S. latissima should be considered to mitigate the environmental effects of {DIN} wastes from salmon farms.},

Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

	abstract = {The bryozoan Membranipora membranacea possesses a long-lived planktonic larva and occurs in encrusting colonies in the Macrocystis pyrifera kelp canopies on southern California. Seasonally Membranipora populations varied from {\textgreater}1000 to less than one colony per kelp blade in late winter and late summer, respectively. Populations often varied by more than an order of magnitude in 2 wk. Several planktonic and benthic factors play important roles in the population dynamics of Membranipora. Upwelling conditions and the presence of two nudibranch predators accounted for 55\% of the variability in larval abundance relative to adult population size. In turn, low recruitment rates relative to larval abundance corresponded with periods of high surface temperatures. The combined effect of larval abundance and surface temperature accounted for 79\% of the Vaccinium in recruitment. Although a field transplant experiment demonstrated that predation plays a major role in the survival of colonies, recruitment was a major factor underlying population fluctuations and accounted for 75\% of the variability in reproduction as indexed by the production of zooids by Membranipora colonies. A 12-fold density-dependent effect on reproduction attributable to space limination and to the density-dependent component of predation was observed over the 1000-fold range in recruitment resulting from density-independent factors. A population model based on field-derived relationships accounted for 64\% of the observed variability in colony density. Temperature, as it affects recruitment, was the major factor controlling the seasonal fluctuations in Membranipora populations. Over longer, multiseasonal time scales the small density-dependent effect was capable of maintaining model populations within the range of values observed in the field and therefore was sufficient to regulate Membranipora populations. The results of this study emphasize the importance of small density-dependent effects in the regulation of single-species populations.},

	abstract = {While the concept and practice of integrated aquaculture is well-known in inland environments particularly in Asia, in the marine environment, it has been much less reported. However, in recent years the idea of integrated aquaculture has been often considered a mitigation approach against the excess nutrients/organic matter generated by intensive aquaculture activities particularly in marine waters. In this context, integrated multitrophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) has emerged, where multitrophic refers to the explicit incorporation of species from different trophic positions or nutritional levels in the same system. Integrated marine aquaculture can cover a diverse range of co-culture/ farming practices, including {IMTA}, and even more specialized forms of integration such as mangrove planting with aquaculture, called aquasilviculture. Integrated mariculture has many benefits, among wich bioremediation is one of the most relevant, and yet is not valued in its real social and economic potential although the present document provides some initial economic estimates for the integration benefits derived from bioremediation. Reducing risks is also an advantage and profitable aspect of farming multiple species in marine environments (as in freshwaters): a diversified product portfolio increases the resilience of the operation, for instance when facing changing prices for one of the farmed species or the accidental catastrophic destruction of a crop. Yet such perspectives are far from been considered in mariculture where, on the contrary, there is a tendency to monoculture. Modern integrated mariculture systems must be developed in order to assist sustainable expansion of the sector in coastal and marine ecosystems thus responding to the global increase for seafood demand but with a new paradigm of more efficient food production systems. Successful integrated mariculture operations must consider all relevant stakeholders into its development plan government, industry, academia, the general public and non-governmental organizations must work together and the role of integrated mariculture within integrated coastal zone management plans must be clearly defined. There is a need to facilitate commercialization and promote effective legislation for the support and inclusion of integrated mariculture through adequate incentives particularly considering the reduction of environmental costs associated to monoculture farming. Bioremediation of fed aquaculture impacts through integrated aquaculture is a core benefit but the increase of production, more diverse and secure business, and larger profits should not be underestimated as additional advantages. In many cases, more research is needed to further integrated mariculture – particularly regarding the technical implementation of a farm. At this level, an important issue is to adopt adequate management practices that avoid or reduce the likelihood of disease transmission within and between aquaculture facilities or to the natural aquatic fauna. Also, careful consideration should be paid to the selection of species used in polyculture or integrated multitrophic aquaculture to reduce potential stress and suffering of culture individuals. Integrated aquaculture should be looked upon as a very important tool to facilitate the growth of marine aquaculture and promote sustainable development.},

	abstract = {Macroalgae has numerous commercial uses and the potential to create large carbon sinks. The study reviewed the legal context, including environmental and social aspects, for the setting up of a seaweed farm in the {UK}. A lease is required to use the seabed and a Marine Licence is required from the national regulator. There is no need for new legislation, however, the existing guidance should be updated. There is a major need to clarify what level of assessment is required as part of the marine licensing process. The environmental and social considerations to licensing were also reviewed. Changes to the hydrodynamics and sediment transport are expected in and around the farm. These may lead to changes in seabed siltation and light levels. The addition of hard substrate (from the anchors) and a macroalgae canopy lead to attraction of benthic animals, fish, marine mammals and birds. These, in addition to potential changes in organic matter and nutrients reaching the seabed from exudate and detritus, could create changes in existing benthic communities on the seafloor. No reason for major population-level impacts were seen. However, numerous knowledge gaps where identified. Scale appears to be an important consideration. A small farm on its own is unlikely to have a large effect on the marine environment. However, a very large farm, or multiple small farms next to each other could have a more notable effect. Knowledge gaps were identified and recommendations were provided that can assist the development of the {UK} macroalgae farming industry.},

	abstract = {Integrated multitrophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) aims to be an ecologically balanced aquaculture practice that co-cultures species from multiple trophic levels to optimise the recycling of farm waste as a food resource. It provides an opportunity for product diversification and an increase in economic return if managed at the optimal stocking densities for each co-cultured species. A generic {IMTA} ecosystem model, incorporating dynamic energy budgets for a number of co-culture species from different trophic levels was developed to design {IMTA} farms for optimisation of multispecies productivity. It is based on the trophic similarity in the ecophysiological behaviour of cultured organisms to describe the uptake and use of energy. This approach can accommodate different species within a trophic group and is transferable to {IMTA} operations based on finfish-shellfish-detritivore-primary producer systems. Model simulations were firstly performed considering the monoculture of mussels and finfish, each " farm" interacting with the natural variability of the local environment. The next step was running the {IMTA} model with the co-culture groups added in: one run was with finfish as the key species in co-culture with seaweed and sea cucumbers and the other with mussels as the key culture species in association with seaweed and sea cucumbers. Scenario simulations show that conversion from monoculture to {IMTA} would considerably reduce waste products and increase farm productivity. Although the development of {IMTA} practices will depend on acceptable levels of waste products, feasibility and profitability of culture operations, the {IMTA} model provides a research tool for designing {IMTA} practices and to understand species interactions and predict productivity of {IMTA} farms. The refinement of the model and its power to predict multispecies productivity depends on emerging data from trial and commercial sea-based {IMTA} operations.},

However, this also implies the use of more sustainable practices to reduce negative environmental impacts currently associated with this industry, including the use of wild resources, destruction of natural ecosystems, eutrophication of effluent receiving bodies, impacts due to inadequate medication practices, among others. Using multi-species systems, such as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, allows to produce economically important species while reducing some of these aquaculture concerns, through biomitigation of aquaculture wastes and reduction of diseases outbreaks, for example. Applying mathematical models to these systems is crucial to control and understand the interactions between species, maximizing productivity, with important environmental and economic benefits. Here, the application of some equations and models available in the literature, regarding basic parameters, is discussed – population dynamics, growth, waste production, and filtering rate – when considering the description and optimization of a theoretical integrated multi-trophic aquaculture operation composed by three trophic levels.},

In the model, parameterization of friction was modified to reflect the patterns of culture configuration in the bay and the results compared with the default case with no culture. Results of model output indicate that suspended aquaculture results in a 20\% reduction in current speed in the main navigation channel and a 54\% reduction in speed in the midst of a culture area. In the channel, reduced flow had little effect on tracer exchange under mid-ebb conditions, but the presence of culture structure caused a 41\% decrease in exchange rate compared with the absence of culture. These results indicate that disregard for physical barriers associated with culture will result in a serious overestimation of the particle renewal term and thus an overestimation of carrying capacity. Further work is required to measure the characteristics of culture (spacing, length scale), quantify their magnitude of flow retardation in the field, and improve model parameterization of the frictional effects of various types of culture.},

	abstract = {As a bio-mitigation strategy of aquafarming pollutants, the integrated multitrophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) system has been proposed and developed to mitigate the waste produced during co-cultivation. Although there have been considerable implementations of {IMTA} worldwide, its optimal design needs a further study. Through a numerical modeling approach, this study aims to facilitate decision-making when designing {IMTA} to more efficiently mitigate the negative change caused by aquaculture. An improved three-dimensional numerical model is adopted to simulate the dynamics of water current and organic waste in Gokasho Bay, Japan. Results show that (1) the maximum main surface water current velocity in Hazama-ura area is less than 10 cm s−1, where nutrient absorbers and/or suspended feeders can easily attach to a substratum; (2) southern-eastern direction water flow is dominant through the year suggesting that seaweeds (e.g., Laminaria japonica, Ulva ohnoi) or mussels (e.g., Mytilus edulis) are better arranged in the same direction; (3) horizontal distribution of organic waste on sea bottom indicates that when releasing sea cucumbers (e.g., Apostichopus japonicus), priority is given to the areas where the accumulated amount of particulate organic waste is high. Our case study provides a general idea on the optimal design of {IMTA} and can be scaled to the globe, especially regarding decision-making on locations for the extractive organisms. In conclusion, to improve the bio-mitigation efficiency of {IMTA}, location for nutrient absorbers and/or suspended feeders can be selected based on local water flow, and sea cucumbers need to be placed with a careful consideration of the waste distribution in local area.},

Integrated multi-trophic aqua- culture ({IMTA}) can mitigate the negative effects of dissolved nutrients emanating from fish farms by harvesting species that extract nutrients grown at adjacent sites. In this study, a coupled 3D hydrodynamic, sediment, and biogeochemical model was used to simulate an idealized temperate test estu- ary. A macroalgal-based {IMTA} model was applied within the estuarine model, to examine the spatial pattern ofphytoplank- ton production arising from increasing levels of finfish aqua- culture and the capacity of Macrocystis pyrifera to bioremediate the impacts ofnutrification. Through increasing fish farm waste loads of dissolved inorganic nitrogen ({DIN}), the water quality in the estuarine model was forced into a "poor water quality" classification as determined by annual mean concentration of chlorophyll. Primary production was greatest in the northern section of the estuary due to circular water motion set up by a region of freshwater influence ({ROFI}). A nonlinear increase in annual phytoplankton biomass was simulated (under elevated finfish loads) due to the occurrence of an additional autumn phytoplankton bloom under elevated fish farm nutrient loads. {IMTA} scenario results demonstrated a strong spatial variability in the capacity of M. pyrifera-based {IMTA} to reduce water column chlorophyll concentration. Siting macroalgae farms next to those finfish farms situated in areas of high natural phytoplankton production resulted in a "good water quality" classification for the whole system. This demonstration of the use {ofIMTA} to improve system wide water quality is valuable for regional planners and managers as it provides an analysis and quantification of a method to achieve estuarine health and economic benefit.},

	abstract = {One of the most difficult tasks resource managers face is understanding the carrying capacity of coastal waters for aquaculture. Aquaculture. like many other human activities, can threaten coastal waters. Understanding eutrophication and the interaction of two different types of aquaculture is very important to the safe and effective management of coastal aquaculture. The first type of aquaculture, producing shrimp and finfish, depends on supplemental feeding and can contribute to eutrophication. The second type, involving bivalve molluscs and macroalgae, extracts plankton and nutrients from surrounding waters and can have a significant positive impact on moderately eutrophic waters. These species depend on the water's basic productivity and will not grow effectively in water with low nutrient levels. Balancing extractive and fed aquaculture is of obvious importance to maximizing the safety and optimizing the carrying capacity of an embayment. Ecosystem modelling offers a three-dimensional physical, chemical and biological simulation that can help scientists and managers understand and predict the eutrophic impact of aquaculture for a specific embayment. Such a model is being explored in China in research sponsored by the Sino-{US} Living Marine Resources Panel. In this study, two projects are using the model to simulate the impact of aquaculture on Jiaozhou Bay, Shangdong Province, and on Xincun Lagoon, Hainan Province. Jiaozhou Bay is in the temperate zone adjacent to the Yellow Sea. There, a major port and industrial city, Qingdao, and scallop and shrimp aquaculture interact with the physical and biological components of the bay. The other modelled environment is very different. Xincun Lagoon is a small embayment (similar to22 km(2)) in southeastern Hainan Island adjacent to the South China Sea. Aquaculture in Xincun Bay includes 6500 fish pens (3 in x 3 in), 100 ha of shrimp ponds, pearl culture rafts and a new macroalgae culture operation that produced 3500 tonnes of Eucheuma in 1998-1999. The surrounding area has similar to15,000 people and Xincun City is a major offshore fishing port (similar to500 vessels, {\textgreater} 10 m length) and Monkey Island Wildlife area with {\textgreater} 400,000 visitors annually. Extractive and fed aquaculture, along with the external activities, all have an impact on the carrying capacity of the bay for aquaculture. These two models show much promise for simulating local eutrophic conditions and for increasing the general understanding of the complex interactions of aquaculture and other human activities. Models that simulate the impact of aquaculture and other human activities and eventually predict carrying capacity should become useful tools for resource managers.},

The model uses national production data for the period 1970–2010 and the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios for production and management for 2010–2050. Results indicate that annual nutrient release to the freshwater (1.2 million tonnes of N and 0.1 million tonnes of P in 2010) and marine aquatic environments (0.3 million tonnes of N and 0.05 million tonnes of P) increased less rapidly than fish production, mainly due to improving feed conversion. In the coming five decades, annual nutrient release to freshwater environments may increase to 1.5–2.1 million tonnes of N and 0.1–0.2 million tonnes of P, depending on the production scenario and assumptions on feed conversion and the share of integrated aquacultural production. At present, the global contribution of freshwater aquaculture to nutrient loading of rivers is small. This is the same conclusion reached for the assessment of nutrient export from shellfish aquaculture (Bouwman et al., 2011). However, particularly in Asia, nutrient loading from freshwater fish production and from seaweed and shellfish production is an important factor that should be accounted for when developing models for estimating river nutrient export. Compared to chicken meat and egg production, freshwater aquaculture is a rapidly growing and important cause of the anthropogenic acceleration of the N and P cycles in many parts of the world, and this is especially pronounced in Asia.},

Global production of crustaceans (18\% yr -1 ), molluscs (7.4\%), and seaweed (8\%) increased rapidly during the 1970-2006 period. Scenarios indicate that annual nutrient release from all shellfish (crustaceans, bivalves, and gastropods) aquaculture will rapidly grow from 0.4 to up to 1.7 million tonnes of nitrogen and from 0.01 to 0.3 million tonnes of phosphorus between 2006 and 2050. The nitrogen and phosphorus releases from global freshwater shellfish aquaculture will increase from 1\% of river export in 2006 to up to 6\% in 2050. Marine shellfish production is an important contributor to nutrient loading of coastal seas, particularly in Eastern Asia. Nitrogen (7\% of marine aquaculture + river export in 2006 and up to 19\% in 2050) and phosphorus (12\% in 2006 and up to 30\% in 2050) releases from Chinese marine shellfish aquaculture are important and growing contributors to total nutrient inputs to coastal seas. Production of crustaceans and bivalves causes changes in nutrient stoichiometry and increasing reduced and organic nitrogen forms, which are of concern because of their preferential use by some harmful algae. Nutrient withdrawal by seaweed is projected to increase rapidly over the coming decades. To overcome effects of increasing nutrient release from shellfish production, integrated systems that include seaweed may play an important role in reducing this nutrient load. © Taylor and Francis Group, {LLC}.},

	abstract = {The aquaculture growth required to meet increasing protein demand by a growing world population, predicted to reach 9. billion people by 2050, is driving innovation in both siting and culture practice. Limited possibilities for expansion on land and in inshore coastal areas, and technological improvements in farming structures, have led to widespread interest in offshore aquaculture.A gilthead bream (Sparus aurata) model has been developed and integrated with existing shellfish models in the Farm Aquaculture Management System ({FARM}) model, in order to analyse various aspects of onshore and offshore aquaculture. The {FARM} model was used to compare the quantitative effects of finfish monoculture with Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture ({IMTA}) in ponds, in terms of production, environmental externalities, and economic performance. Very clear benefits of {IMTA} could be seen in the comparison. The same approach was then applied to offshore culture, considering a combination of gilthead in cages and Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) suspended from longlines. For offshore culture, the primary production and diagenesis modules of {FARM} were switched off, since there are no feedbacks from those processes to the farm area. Except in upwelling areas, the concentration of food drivers for filter-feeding shellfish falls markedly with distance from the shore-simulations with {FARM} suggest that in food-poor areas, co-cultivation of bivalves with fish can significantly improve shellfish production, and that the distribution of finfish can be optimised to reduce shellfish food depletion in the inner parts of the farm. We calculate the environmental benefits of {IMTA} both in terms of population-equivalents and the potential for nutrient credit trading. The finfish model integrated in {FARM} deals explicitly with the metabolic energy cost of opposing offshore currents in cage culture, and a model analysis suggests that gilthead cultivation at current speeds in the range of 0.1 to 0.5ms -1 is optimal. The lower end of that spectrum probably translates into a greater deviation from the fillet quality obtained from wild fish, and above that limit there is a rapid increase of the feed conversion ratio ({FCR}) and cultivation becomes financially unattractive. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

However, sufficient quantitative assessment of {IMTA} is still lacking for decision makers, ecosystem managers and farmers to promote the application of {IMTA} in open-water systems. In this study, we investigated three types of culture models in Sanggou Bay, China, which were the monoculture of kelps, the monoculture of scallops, and the polyculture of kelps and scallops ({IMTA}), in order to compare the ecological and economic benefits between monocultures and {IMTA} in open-water systems. We developed an emergy analysis framework for mariculture ecosystems, which revealed significant differences in the energy flow process among the three culture models. The emergy analysis showed that {IMTA} had the largest environmental sustainability index ({ESI}), indicating the highest sustainability, among the three culture models. Using the cost-benefit analysis ({CBA}), we developed a new index, the relative coefficient ({RC}), to balance the benefits and the efficiency of culture models. As revealed by the {CBA}, {IMTA} exhibited the highest net present value ({NPV}), the highest benefit to cost ratio ({BCR}), and the highest {RC} among the three models, suggesting that {IMTA} is the optimal model with both economic and environmental benefits.

	abstract = {Integrated multitrophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) has been proposed as a solution to nutrient enrichment generated by intensive fish mariculture. In order to evaluate the potential of {IMTA} as a nutrient bioremediation method it is essential to know the ratio of fed to extractive organisms required for the removal of a given proportion of the waste nutrients. This ratio depends on the species that compose the {IMTA} system, on the environmental conditions and on production practices at a target site. Due to the complexity of {IMTA} the development of a model is essential for designing efficient {IMTA} systems. In this study, a generic nutrient flux model for {IMTA} was developed and used to assess the potential of {IMTA} as a method for nutrient bioremediation. A baseline simulation consisting of three growth models for Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and for the macroalgae Ulva sp. is described. The three growth models interact with each other and with their surrounding environment and they are all linked via processes that affect the release and assimilation of particulate organic nitrogen ({PON}) and dissolved inorganic nitrogen ({DIN}). The model forcing functions are environmental parameters with temporal variations that enables investigation of the understanding of interactions among {IMTA} components and of the effect of environmental parameters. The baseline simulation has been developed for marine species in a virtually closed system in which hydrodynamic influences on the system are not considered. The model can be used as a predictive tool for comparing the nitrogen bioremediation efficiency of {IMTA} systems under different environmental conditions (temperature, irradiance and ambient nutrient concentration) and production practices, for example seaweed harvesting frequency, seaweed culture depth, nitrogen content of feed and others, or of {IMTA} systems with varying combinations of cultured species and can be extended to open water {IMTA} once coupled with waste distribution models.},

Ocean warming along southeast Australia has already been linked to dramatic losses of kelp species and is contributing to the range expansion and population increases of two species of sea urchin. This research attempts to understand the impact of multiple stressors on the decline in kelps in this region. Location Coastal Waters of Victoria, Southeast Australia. Methods In this study, we use long-term ({\textgreater}20 years) datasets on biological observations across Victorian waters to determine trends in coverage and the impact of multiple environmental variables (oceanography, habitat, and urchin abundances) on two important kelps that serve as foundation species (Phyllospora comosa and Ecklonia radiata) using boosted regression trees. These models were then used to develop predictive distribution models for each species and also to project abundance distributions into the future. Results We found that both kelp species are decreasing in percent coverage over time with multiple environmental variables contributing to these declines, including increasing temperatures, intensifying wave energy, changes in currents and recruitment patterns, and increases in urchin populations. Additionally, future projections of temperature, wave energy, and urchin populations show that both species will continue to decrease across 62\%–94\% of their range by 2090. Main conclusions Long-term biological datasets allowed us to develop maps of the past, current, and future distributions of these important foundation species, providing valuable information to managers for prioritization of areas for targeted urchin management and restoration of kelps. Understanding the environmental factors affecting their distribution helps guide manager restoration investments in regions where kelp populations are most likely to persist in the future.},

While the {ECOSIM} predictions can be expected to fail under fishing regimes very different from those leading to the {ECOPATH} input data, {ECOSIM} will at least indicate likely directions of biomass change in various trophic groups under incremental experimental policies aimed at improving overall ecosystem management.

	abstract = {A National System of Marine Protected Areas ({NRSMPA}) is currently being
established in Australia with the collaboration of governments at the State and Federal
level. In Tasmania this policy is articulated in the State Marine Protected Area Strategy
({MMIC} 2001) that recognises the need for a Comprehensive, Adequate and
Representative ({CAR}) system of {MPAs} for State waters. The State and Commonwealth
{MPA} implementation strategies each recognise that for {MPAs} to be established on a
{CAR} basis, a thorough inventory of marine habitats is needed to ensure areas selected
are appropriate.
This study presents the first such inventory for Tasmanian waters, with detailed
mapping of marine habitats within the Bruny Bioregion. The study had two objectives,
to map the marine habitats in the Bruny Bioregion and to use this information to
identify candidate {MPAs} that fulfil {CAR} requirements. While Tasmanian waters
include nine bioregions, the Bruny region was identified as a priority for mapping due
to its high degree of marine endemism, high habitat diversity and the more urgent need
for protection given the high population density of the region in close association with
the capital city, Hobart.
Maps were produced at a scale of 1:25,000, showing the principal habitat types in
shallow inshore coastal waters to the 40 m depth contour. The production of maps
involved extensive field surveys of the region from small vessels equipped with colour
sounders and differential {GPS}. Position, depth and bottom type were continuously
logged in real time using a computer application developed for this task. Regular video
drops were conducted to validate interpretation of sounder signals. Aerial photographs
were scanned and rectified to provide more detailed information on habitats in inshore
areas where water clarity allowed. For most of the coast the utility of aerial
photographs was limited to a depth of ten metres. The information was collated and
mapped using the {GIS} application {ArcView}, allowing detailed analysis of habitat
distribution by depth and exposure.
The habitat maps were then used to suggest a number of potential {MPA} locations that
would protect a comprehensive range of marine habitats within this bioregion.
Sufficient information is also available for discussion of alternative {MPA} options as
part of stakeholder negotiations during the implementation of the Tasmanian Marine
Protected Area Strategy (2001).},

	abstract = {Fur seal populations in the Southern Hemisphere were plundered in the late 1700s and early 1800s to provide fur for a clothing industry. Millions of seals were killed resulting in potentially major ecosystem changes across the Southern Hemisphere, the consequences of which are unknown today. Following more than a century of population suppression, partly through on-going harvesting, many of the fur seal populations started to recover in the late 1900s. Australian fur seals (
              Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus
              ), one of the most geographically constrained fur seal species, followed this trend. From the 1940s to 1986, pup production remained at approximately 10,000 per year, then significant growth commenced. By 2007, live pup abundance had recovered to approximately 21,400 per year and recovery was expected to continue However, a species-wide survey in 2013 recorded a 20\% decline, to approximately 16,500 live pups. It was not known if this decline was due to 2013 being a poor breeding year or a true population reduction. Here we report the results of a population-wide survey conducted in 2017 and annual monitoring at the most productive colony, Seal Rocks, Victoria that recorded a large decline in live pup abundance (-28\%). Sustained lower pup numbers at Seal Rocks from annual counts between 2012–2017 (mean = 2908 ± 372 {SD}), as well as the population-wide estimate of 16,903 live pups in 2017, suggest that the pup numbers for the total population have remained at the lower level observed in 2013 and that the 5-yearly census results are not anomalies or representative of poor breeding seasons. Potential reasons for the decline, which did not occur range-wide but predominantly in the most populated and long-standing breeding sites, are discussed. To enhance adaptive management of this species, methods for future monitoring of the population are also presented. Australian fur seals occupy several distinct regions influenced by different currents and upwellings: range-wide pup abundance monitoring enables comparisons of ecosystem status across these regions. Forces driving change in Australian fur seal pup numbers are likely to play across other marine ecosystems, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere where most fur seals live.},

The resultant culture area and densities of seaweeds required for full equivalent nutrient sequestration may havemeaning only to experienced aquaculturists. Consequently, a novel ratio model is proposedwhich determines the weight ratio of harvested seaweeds required to sequester an equivalent weight of soluble inorganic nutrients loaded per unit growth of fish. Soluble inorganic nutrient excretion from Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, was estimated using a semi-stochastic nutritional mass balance approach. Oxygen demand was estimated using respiratory quotients. Nutrient contents of the {IMTA} kelps, Alaria esculenta and Saccharina latissima, were mea- sured at harvest times, and net oxygen production was estimated using the photosynthetic equation. To quantify uncertainty, input parameters were assigned theoretical distributions (based on empirical or literature data) and the model was run using a stratified sampling approach (Latin Hypercube) over multiple iterations, to generate distributions of weight ratios for the various nutrients. A mathematical simulation of nutrient loading from a salmon farm over a full production cycle was estimated usingmean loading values per unit growth, with month- ly growth estimated by a thermal growth coefficient ({TGC}). Results showed that one kilogramme {ofAtlantic} salmon growth (large fish fed a typical commercial feed, ±stan- dard deviation) resulted in the excretion of29.49 ± 4.20 g nitrogen, 2.26 ± 2.25 g phosphorus and the respira- tion of 243.38 ± 48.28 g carbon. Dissolved oxygen requirements for 1 kg of growth were 455.29 ± 86.24 g. Salmon smolts placed in cages in spring and harvested 21 months later, load approximately 4 times more nutri- ents in the second grow-out season. The mean ratios of A. esculenta weight required to sequester nutrients ex- creted per unit weight of S. salar production were 6.7(±1.5):1 for nitrogen, 4.8(±3.0):1 for phosphorus, and 5.8(±1.4):1 for carbon. Oxygen could be supplied at aweight ratio of4.1(±1.0):1. Themean ratios {ofS}. latissima were 12.9(±2.7):1 for nitrogen, 10.5(±6.2):1 for phosphorus, and 10.2(±2.2):1 for carbon. Oxygen could be supplied at a weight ratio of 7.2(±1.5):1. A. esculenta appears to have almost twice the nutrient sequestration capacity per wet weight than S. latissima. However, culture densities of S. latissima are 1.5 times greater than those for A. esculenta and when spatially weighted this difference is reduced to 1–1.5 times. Numbers of rafts for both kelp species required for full nutrient sequestration from a commercial scale salm- on farm exceed the number of rafts which can be practically deployed within a typical site lease area. How- ever, not all inorganic nutrients from cultured fish will be available to {IMTA} seaweeds, nor should 100\% nutrient sequestration need be the only successful endpoint in such systems. These aspects should be consid- ered when assessing the net value of kelps in open-water {IMTA} systems.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine nutrient concentrations in the vicinity of fish farm cages to maximise potential utilization by cultured macroalgae. At 4 m depth, nitrate and phosphate concentrations did not vary significantly with distance from fish farm cages. Elevated levels of ammonium were detected for extended periods of time during the day for distances that exceed 200 m. Principal enhancements were within 50 m in the direction of currents, and no increases were detected in the direction from which the current impacted the cages. Ammonium concentrations measured at 4 m depth within 50 m of the cages reached a maximum of 8 μM but most ranged from 2 to 4 μM and 2–3 μM above background. While current measurements gave an indication of ammonium distributions, the geography of the site and the physical presence of the fish farm cages were influencing factors. The highest concentrations of ammonium found at these fish farm sites were on the lee sides of cages in shallow water. Concentrations of ammonium throughout a relatively small-enclosed bay with fish farms were higher than in a similar bay without fish farms consistent with broader scale effects of nutrient enhancement. Multiple drogues used to follow currents were found to be a valuable tool for prediction of enhanced ammonium concentrations. The data suggest that there are elevated levels of ammonium at appropriate depths for potential utilization by marine macroalgae (i.e. in the photic zone) for an extended period of time at distances from the fish farm cages greater than 50 m. Careful assessment of current patterns around farm cages should be made if the objective is to maximise exposure of cultured algae to farm-derived nutrients.},

Of the total feed input, 70\% C, 62\% N and 70\% P were released into the environment, equivalent to an annual discharge of about 404 000, 50 600 and 9400 t of C, N and P, respectively, based on total salmon production of 1.02 × 106 t. We predicted that 48\% of feed C was respired as {CO}2, 45\% of feed N was excreted as dissolved inorganic N ({DIN}), and 18\% of feed P was excreted as dissolved inorganic P ({DIP}). Approximately 44\% of feed P was released as particles, dominating solid wastes. The mean food conversion ratio (feed supplied per fish produced) of Norwegian salmon farms was 1.16 ± 0.08 {SE} in 2009. Estimates of the potential for {IMTA} driven by salmon farming showed a far higher potential for seaweed production based on the released {DIN} than for mussel production based on released appropriately sized particulate organic carbon ({POC}). The daily volumetric loading rates of {DIN} from salmon farms (range for counties: 40 to 501 μg N m-3 d-1) were {\textless}15\% of the natural loading rate of nitrate from deep water, suggesting that the nutrient loading rate is within safe limits.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) plays critical roles in marine carbon cycling, but its sources and sinks remain uncertain. In this study, we monitored {DOC} exudation rates of Sargassum natans under visible light (λ {\textgreater} 390 nm) and solar radiation. {DOC} release rates ranged from 7 to 10 μg C g−1biomass hr−1 (wet weight) under visible light, but increased to 23 to 41 μg C g−1biomass hr−1 when exposed to natural sunlight. Results indicate that {DOC} released by Sargassum could amount to 0.3 to 1.2 Tg C/year, potentially contributing significantly to the marine {DOC} pool in the Gulf of Mexico and Western North Atlantic. We employed the Folin-Ciocalteu phenolic content method, nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR}) spectroscopy, and ultrahigh resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ({FT}-{ICR} {MS}) to characterize the diverse pool of organic compounds exuded from Sargassum. Results from these complementary methods showed that Sargassum release large quantities of phlorotannins, a class of polyphenols that have very similar properties to terrestrial {DOC}. These phlorotannins and their oxygenated phenolic derivatives exhibit a high hydrogen deficiency and functionalization (i.e., 4 to 6 oxygen atoms per aromatic ring), representing 5 to 18\% of the released {DOC} isolated by solid phase extraction. Thus, Sargassum is the largest biological source of open ocean polyphenols recorded to date. The amount of polyphenolic {DOC} released by Sargassum challenges previous beliefs that all polyphenols found within the oceans are remnants of terrestrial organic matter, although the stability of phlorotannins and their derivatives needs to be further evaluated.},

These data were incorporated into an empirical model of reef-scale net primary production ({NPP}) at Mohawk Reef in southern California, U.S.A. for an 8-yr period. Rates of {DOC} release of incubated blades varied unpredictably with time of year, but were significantly related to the irradiance at the sea surface during the incubations. The growth stage, C/N ratio, and epiphyte load of the blades and the temperature of the ocean during the incubations had no discernable effect on rates of {DOC} release. Blades produced on average 2-3 times more {DOC} than stipes, and stipes and blades produced on average 30\% and 80\% more {DOC} respectively during the day compared to the night. Modeled {DOC} {NPP} at the reef scale was on average highest in summer and spring ({\textasciitilde}0.5 g C m-2 d-1) and lowest in winter and autumn ({\textasciitilde}0.31 g C m-2 d-1), but it varied greatly among years for any given season as large oscillations in standing biomass led to corresponding fluctuations in reef-scale {DOC} {NPP}. The fraction of {NPP} released as {DOC} was highly variable when examined at the monthly time scale, but became much more stable at seasonal and annual time scales averaging 14\% of total {NPP}.},

Commercial salmon farming requires a significant level of certainty regarding fish count, average weight measurement, live weight distribution, and other production indicators. A reliable control system for assessing the biomass of farmed Atlantic salmon is essential for sustainable and cost-effective precision aquaculture. A study was done in four production sea-cages in a Chilean Atlantic salmon marine grow-out farm to estimate the average weight and frequency distribution utilizing the Vaki Biomassdaily® diode frames as an alternate technology to manual weight measurement. From post-smolt reception to fish harvest, diode frames were put in each sea-cage in a secure position for 15 months. There were no significant changes in length or average weight between manual sampling and frame estimate. The mean degree of accuracy for the average weight estimation was 98.83 \% for the frames utilized in the four sea cages. The diode frames also achieved a high degree of precision in predicting the frequency distribution of fish. There were no statistically significant variations between the distribution variances of the diode frame measurements and the distribution variances of the fish received at the fish processing facility ({FPF}). The maximum difference between the average weight calculated by the frames and the average weight of the fish received in the processing facility was 2.4 \%, with 99.66 \% being the highest accuracy with only 19 g of difference. We determined that diode frames might replace manual weight assessments with greater reliability for growth monitoring and production management. To assure the optimal performance of the diode frames in terms of accuracy and precision for future commercial-scale validations in the salmon farming business, the development of a standard best practice manual is necessary.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2018.00418},
	abstract = {Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) has the potential of reducing open-cage fish farming impacts on the environment while also introducing new value chains. The aim of this study was to investigate the growth and composition of the kelp Saccharina latissima in salmon-driven {IMTA}, and to assess the spatial extent of the influence of salmon derived nitrogen in order to evaluate the upscaling potential for {IMTA}. S. latissima was cultivated 100, 200, and 1,000 m east and 1,000 m west of a 5,000 tons salmon farm in Western Norway from February to September 2013. The proportion of salmon derived nitrogen available for the kelp showed a clear decline with distance from the farm. Accordingly, the kelp cultivated near the salmon cages grew faster during the spring season, and growth rate decreased with increasing distance from the farm. A spatially explicit numerical model system ({SINMOD}), including compartments for dissolved nutrients and kelp growth, was tuned to the field data and used to investigate the potential for upscaling {IMTA} production. The model was used to introduce a new metric-the impacted area {IA}-for the areal effects of {IMTA} in terms of the increase in production by {IMTA}. The model showed that a 25 hectare kelp farm in the vicinity of the studied salmon farm could take up 1.6 of the 13.5 tons of dissolved inorganic nitrogen released during kelp cultivation, amounting to almost 12\% of the ammonia released during the cultivation period from February to June. The 25 hectare kelp farm would have a production yield of 1,125 tons fresh weight ({FW}), being 60\% more than that of a non-{IMTA} kelp farm, while a 20\% increase of kelp {FW} could be obtained over a 110 hectar area in salmon-driven {IMTA}.

	abstract = {Diet studies of the South American sea lion ({SASL}) in Chile suggest that this species is an opportunistic and generalist predator whose diet varies depending on the distribution of prey species and spatial and temporal variations in the abundance of these dams. However, these studies have been sporadic, geographically limited and based on stomach content analysis, which does not allow an integral analysis of the composition of the diet of this species and its potential spatial and temporal variability. In this study we analyzed the diet of the {SASL} in 3 geographic zones of the coast of Chile using analysis of stable isotopes 13C and 15N on hair and skin tissues. In the northern zone, the main prey species consumed by {SASL} were Isacia conceptionis (19.5\%) for skin and Cilus gilberti (23.3\%) for hair; in the central zone were Thyrsites atun (40.1\%) for skin and Strangomera bentincki (31.1\%) for hair, whereas in the southern zone the main species were pelagic fish (such as T. atun and Trachurus murphyi, 20.8\%) for skin and farm-raised salmonids (20.7\%) for hair analysis. These differences indicate variation in the composition of its diet. Variations between the analyzed tissues and also with previous studies suggest that this species is capable of adapting to intra- and inter-annual variations in the presence/absence of its prey.},

Isotope mixing models show that the primary prey consumed by {SASL} were demersal and benthopelagic fishes. Individuals sampled in summer and in the outer coast had higher δ15N values than those from winter or from the inner coast due to consumption of high trophic level demersal fish. We also found evidence of an ontogenetic shift in isotopic niche width as measured by δ13C and δ15N standard ellipse areas, with juveniles showing a restricted isotopic niche width (1.0‰2) in comparison to subadult (2.2‰2) and adult males (1.9‰2). The proportion of salmonids in the diet of the {SASL} was negligible and lower than reported in previous studies, which may be related to a recent drop in the production of salmon aquaculture in the region. Our study suggests that the {SASL} are able to adapt to shifts in spatiotemporal variations in the abundance of potential prey, including feral and farmed salmonids.},

	abstract = {This dataset includes Continuous Plankton Recorder ({CPR}) data, as part of the Australian Plankton Survey ({AusCPR}). The dataset comprises zooplankton abundance and biomass index. The biomass index is the dried mass of the plankton washed off the silk and dried in an oven at 60oC for 24 hours. This, therefore, represent the total plankton biomass.

To understand how {CPR} plankton data is analysed and how to use {CPR} data we recommend reading Richardson et al., 2006.

The data are made available in binned products for ease of use. As taxonomy changes over time and the ability of analysts improves with training more and more species can be identified over time. The products account for these changes and for real absences from the samples. A 0 abundance means that the species was looked for and not seen, null (empty cell) means that the species was not looked for in that sample. The products are therefore applicable for use in time series analysis.

There are a total of 6 products to choose from.
Zooplankton abundance products are available at 5 levels:
Raw product (includes all data)
Copepods product (all data where species have been identified, Copepods only)
Non-Copepods product (all data where species have been identified, non-Copepods only)
Genus product (includes all data binned to genus level)
Higher taxonomic group (includes all data binned to functional groups).
(each of these products includes the biomass index per samples)
Plus
Derived indices (useful indices at segment level for {CPR} data)

Plankton abundances were originally provided on the {AODN} Portal only as raw data, in flat table form (with each species recorded in a separate row), without any adjustments for taxonomy changes or real absences.
The first version of the "analysis-ready" products were first published on 21/12/2018. However, they were removed again in April 2021 because technical issues prevented them from being regularly updated.},

Acid Lugol’s iodine caused cells to shrink immediately. The shrinkage effect was constant for concentrations of 1–10\% Lugol’s iodine (in seawater). For optically measured cells fixed in 2\% Lugol’s iodine, volume of live cells = 1.33 × (volume of fixed cells). Coulter Counter and optically measured volumes did not agree. For live cells, optical cell volume = 1.24–2.04 × (Coulter Counter determined volume); this difference is likely due to inaccurate volume measurements of non-spherical cells by the Coulter Counter and by inaccurate microscopy resulting from optical distortions (errors of {\textless}0.5 µm in cell dimensions). Cell quota estimates were presented following the relation y = axb, where x = optically measured cell volume (µm3), y = any cell constituent (pg cell−1), and a and b are constants. The constants a and b were 0.109 and 0.991 for carbon, 0.0172 and 1.023 for nitrogen, 0.043 and 1.058 for protein, and 0.00428 and 0.917 for Chl a.

Our data can be used to determine carbon, nitrogen, protein, and Chl a estimates from field material that has been fixed with Lugol’s iodine, observed live, optically measured, or Coulter Counter measured; however, the variability in published data suggests that any of these estimates will have a large potential error.},

	abstract = {Seabirds are ideal model organisms to track mercury (Hg) through marine food webs as they are long-lived, broadly distributed, and are susceptible to biomagnification due to foraging at relatively high trophic levels. However, using these species as biomonitors requires a solid understanding of the degree of species, sexual and age-specific variation in foraging behaviors which act to mediate their dietary exposure to Hg. We combined stomach content analysis along with Hg and stable isotope analyses of blood, feathers and common prey items to help explain inter and intra-specific patterns of dietary Hg exposure across three sympatric Pygoscelis penguin species commonly used as biomonitors of Hg availability in the Antarctic marine ecosystem. We found that penguin tissue Hg concentrations differed across species, between adults and juveniles, but not between sexes. While all three penguins species diets were dominated by Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) and to a lesser extent fish, stable isotope based proxies of relative trophic level and krill consumption could not by itself sufficiently explain the observed patterns of inter and intra-specific variation in Hg. However, integrating isotopic approaches with stomach content analysis allowed us to identify the relatively higher risk of Hg exposure for penguins foraging on mesopelagic prey relative to congeners targeting epipelagic or benthic prey species. When possible, future seabird biomonitoring studies should seek to combine isotopic approaches with other, independent measures of foraging behavior to better account for the confounding effects of inter and intra-specific variation on dietary Hg exposure.
During starvation, energy production occurs at the expense of body reserve utilisation which results in body mass loss. Knowing the role of the fuels involved in this body mass loss, along with their energy density, can allow an energy equivalent of mass loss to be calculated. Therefore, it is possible to determine daily energy expenditure ({DEE}) if two body mass loss measurements at an interval of a few days are obtained. The technique can be cheap, minimally stressful for the animals involved, and the data relatively simple to gather. Here we review the use of body mass loss to estimate {DEE} in birds through critiquing the strengths and weaknesses of the technique, and detail the methodology and considerations that must be adhered to for accurate measures of {DEE} to be obtained. Owing to the biology of the species, the use of the technique has been used predominantly in Antarctic seabirds, particularly penguins and albatrosses. We demonstrate how reliable the technique can be in predicting {DEE} in a non-Antarctic species, common eiders (Somateria mollissima), the female of which undergoes a fasting period during incubation. We conclude that using daily body mass loss to estimate {DEE} can be a useful and effective approach provided that (1) the substrate being consumed during mass loss is known, (2) the kinetics of body mass loss are understood for the species in question and (3) only species that enter a full phase {II} of a fast (where substrate catabolism reaches a steady state) and are not feeding for a period of time are appropriate for this method.
Clinical hematology and biochemistry are recognized as useful aids in health diagnosis in birds. The Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor) is endemic to Australia and numbers are declining due to a number of factors including declining health. This 2-year study on both Bowen and Lion Island populations aimed at assessing the potential causes of their declining health. Blood was collected from a total of 294 adult Little Penguins. R.B.C., Hb, P.C.V., M.C.V., M.C.H., M.C.H.C., W.B.C. and differential counts, thrombocytes and T.P.P. were measured. Multiple regression was used to identify relationships between hematological values and the following predictor variables: site, season, sex, time held prior to sampling and body condition. Values obtained showed some differences compared to the values for other penguin species reported in the literature. P.C.V., R.B.C., Hb, M.C.H.C. and T.P.P. showed major differences in comparison with a previous study on little penguins. Considering the influence of predictor variables, it appeared that: P.C.V., R.B.C., M.C.V., M.C.H., M.C.H.C. varied according to seasons; P.C.V., R.B.C., M.C.H., T.P.P. were correlated to body condition; P.C.V. was higher in birds on Bowen Island compared to birds on Lion Island; and T.P.P. was higher in females. These ecological and biological predictor variables have a strong influence upon hematological values. As a consequence, they must be taken into consideration when interpreting results of future studies.
In this paper I attempt to explain the seasonal foraging strategy employed by male northern shovelers (Anas clypeata). Through the use of dynamic-optimization modeling I demonstrate that male shovelers are optimizing total foraging time over the entire summer by foraging heavily when resources (cladocerans) are abundant and utilizing endogenous reserves during times when resources are in short supply. Additionally, I construct predictive long-term models based on cladoceran dynamics and show that observed values for shoveler body mass and foraging dynamics agree with the models. Body masses of collected birds fit the predictions of the mixed (long-term I) model better than the long-term {II} model. However, both models underestimated total foraging time often by as much as 50\% Long-term foraging optimization strategies apparently are more common in birds than previously thought and are determined by three ecological criteria: (1) degree of foraging specialization, (2) availability of preferred prey, and (3) physiological or behavioral constraints which allow for endogenous fat storage or exogenous caching of food items.
1.1. Plasma concentrations of urea, uric acid and total lipid were compared in pre- and late-fast breeding and moulting macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) to test the hypothesis that birds exhaust their lipid reserves and initiate marked protein utilisation towards the end of natural fasts.2.2. Male and female macaroni penguins fasted for a minimum of 29–32 days and 20 days during the breeding and moult fasts, and the difference in body weight over the sample period (reflecting body weight loss) was 31–34\% and 41–47\%, respectively.3.3. There was no significant increase in plasma urea or uric acid at the end of either fast, nor any decrease in plasma lipid concentrations compared to pre-fast birds.4.4. These results suggest that macaroni penguins continue to rely mainly on lipid reserves during the later stages of natural fasts. This is consistent with post-fast body composition data for other small penguin species.
1.1. Dynamics of plasma nutrients and metabolites in moulting macaroni (Eudyptes chrysolophus) and gentoo (Pygoscelis papua) penguins were studied.2.2. The late moult macaroni and gentoo penguins had significantly elevated levels of total lipid and cholesterol, α-tocopherol (vitamin E) and alkaline phosphatase activity compared to early moult birds.3.3. Conversely, the mean concentrations of total protein, albumin, globulin, urate, creatinine, iron, calcium, inorganic phosphate, all-trans retinol and the activity of aspartate transaminase were lower in the late moult groups in both species.4.4. Mean concentrations of lipid, cholesterol, retinol (vitamin A), α-tocopherol (vitamin E), total protein, albumin, globulin, calcium and sodium were higher in the pre-moult than in the early moult macaronis.5.5. Dietary influence may partly account for the higher nutrient status of the pre-moult birds.6.6. Both the early and late moult macaronis had raised levels of total lipid, cholesterol, a-tocopherol and potassium compared to the corresponding gentoos.7.7. Total protein, albumin, globulin, sodium and inorganic phosphate concentrations, however, were higher in the later species.8.8. Differences in the levels of the plasma nutrients between the early and late moult macaronis, and their counterpart gentoos is due to species-specific variability.
The Brown Norway ({BN}; {BN}/{NHsdMcwi}) rat exhibits a deficit in ventilatory {CO}2 sensitivity and a modest serotonin (5-{HT}) deficiency. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine would augment {CO}2 sensitivity in {BN} but not Sprague Dawley ({SD}) rats. Ventilation during room air or 7\% {CO}2 exposure was measured before, during and after 3 weeks of daily injections of saline or fluoxetine (10 mg/(kg day)) in adult male {BN} and {SD} rats. Fluoxetine had minimal effects on room air breathing in {BN} and {SD} rats (p {\textgreater} 0.05), although tidal volume ({VT}) was reduced in {BN} rats (p {\textless} 0.05). There were also minimal effects of fluoxetine on {CO}2 sensitivity in {SD} rats, but fluoxetine increased minute ventilation, breathing frequency and {VT} during hypercapnia in {BN} rats (p {\textless} 0.05). The augmented {CO}2 response was reversible upon withdrawal of fluoxetine. Brain levels of biogenic amines were largely unaffected, but 5-{HIAA} and the ratio of 5-{HIAA}/5-{HT} were reduced (p {\textless} 0.05) consistent with selective and effective 5-{HT} reuptake inhibition. Thus, fluoxetine increases ventilatory {CO}2 sensitivity in {BN} but not {SD} rats, further suggesting altered 5-{HT} system function may contribute to the inherently low {CO}2 sensitivity in the {BN} rat.
Four species of threatened or declining eider ducks that nest in the Arctic migrate through the northeast Chukchi Sea, where anticipated industrial development may require prioritizing areas for conservation. In this nearshore corridor (10–40 m depth), the eiders’ access to benthic prey during the spring is restricted to variable areas of open water within sea ice. For the most abundant species, the king eider (Somateria spectabilis), stable isotopes in blood cells, muscle, and potential prey indicate that these eiders ate mainly bivalves when traversing this corridor. Bivalves there were much smaller than the same taxa in deeper areas of the northern Bering Sea, possibly due to higher mortality rates caused by ice scour in shallow water; future decrease in seasonal duration of fast ice may increase this effect. Computer simulations suggested that if these eiders forage for {\textgreater}15 h/day, they can feed profitably at bivalve densities {\textgreater}200 m−2 regardless of water depth or availability of ice for resting. Sampling in 2010–2012 showed that large areas of profitable prey densities occurred only in certain locations throughout the migration corridor. Satellite data in April–May over 13 years (2001–2013) indicated that access to major feeding areas through sea ice in different segments of the corridor can vary from 0\% to 100\% between months and years. In a warming and increasingly variable climate, unpredictability of access may be enhanced by greater effects of shifting winds on unconsolidated ice. Our results indicate the importance of having a range of potential feeding areas throughout the migration corridor to ensure prey availability in all years. Spatial planning of nearshore industrial development in the Arctic, including commercial shipping, pipeline construction, and the risk of released oil, should consider these effects of high environmental variability on the adequacy of habitats targeted for conservation.
A major source of uncertainty in the estimation of radiation dose to wildlife is the prediction of internal radionuclide activity concentrations. Allometric (mass-dependent) relationships describing biological half-life (T1/2b) of radionuclides in organisms can be used to predict organism activity concentrations. The establishment of allometric expressions requires experimental data which are often lacking. An approach to predict the T1/2b in homeothermic vertebrates has recently been proposed. In this paper we have adapted this to be applicable to reptiles. For Cs, Ra and Sr, over a mass range of 0.02–1.5 kg, resultant predictions were generally within a factor of 6 of reported values demonstrating that the approach can be used when measured T1/2b data are lacking. However, the effect of mass on reptilian radionuclide T1/2b is minimal. If sufficient measured data are available for a given radionuclide then it is likely that these would give a reasonable estimate of T1/2b in any reptile species.
Chemical activity quantifies the energetic level of an organic compound relative to its pure liquid [0–1], and several studies have reported that baseline toxicity generally requires chemical activities of 0.01–0.1. The first aim was to challenge this chemical activity range for baseline toxicity. Algal growth inhibition data (median effective concentrations, {EC}50) were compiled from two recent studies and included 108 compounds categorised as non-polar (mode of toxic action, {MOA}1) and polar ({MOA}2) narcotics. These data were linked to chemical activity by (1) plotting them relative to a regression for (subcooled) liquid solubility ({SL}), which served as visual reference for chemical activity of unity and (2) determining {EC}50/{SL} ratios that essentially equal median effective chemical activity (Ea50). Growth inhibition required chemical activity {\textgreater}0.01 for {MOA}1 and {\textgreater}0.001 for {MOA}2 compounds. The second aim was to identify compounds exerting excess toxicity, i.e., when growth inhibition occurred at chemical activity {\textless}0.001. From a recent review with 2323 data entries, 315 {EC}50 values passed our selection criteria. 280 of these {EC}50 values were within or near the baseline toxicity range (Ea50{\textgreater}0.001), and 25 compounds were found to exert excess toxicity (Ea50{\textless}0.001). Of these compounds, 16 are pesticides or precursors. Methodologically, this study includes two methods for translating {EC}50 values into the chemical activity framework, each having advantages and limitations. Scientifically, this study confirms that baseline toxicity generally requires chemical activities of 0.01–0.1 and extends the application of the chemical activity approach beyond baseline toxicity, by demonstrating its utility to identify compounds that exert excess toxicity.
This paper focuses on the solute – solute interactions in dilute solutions of a typically hydrophobic solute tetramethylurea ({TMU}) in ethylene glycol ({EG}) which forms the three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network at the supramolecular level. The results of our experimental efforts based on dilution calorimetry and phase partition techniques are able to make a conclusion that thermodynamics of the {TMU} – {TMU} pairwise interaction in {EG} is to a great extent similar to that occurs in liquid water. All effects, however, are weaker expressed in the non-aqueous medium. In particular, the integrand of the potential of mean force, i.e. the second virial coefficient, between two {TMU} molecules becomes negative only at elevated temperatures indicating the appearance of a rather weak solvophobic interaction in {EG}. Since C=O-groups of {TMU} are well-incorporated into the H-bond network of {EG}, it is reasonable to assume that the attraction observed should be mainly induced by apolar methyl groups. The correlation between the enthalpy- and volume-related parameters of pairwise interaction provides the additional confirmation of the existence of the solvent-induced solvophobic interaction between {TMU} molecules in {EG}.
Marking dependency is a powerful tool that allows different firing time distributions to be associated with a stochastic Petri net transition, depending on the marking. Through this feature, the modeler can easily and compactly represent advanced properties and behaviors of the system. While a semantics and specific solution techniques have been provided for generalized stochastic Petri nets thus covering homogeneous Markovian aspects, in the non-homogeneous/non-Markovian case marking dependency still needs to be investigated. To fill this gap, this paper provides a formalization of marking dependent semantics in non-Markovian stochastic Petri nets ({NMSPNs}) and a solution technique, based on phase type distributions and Kronecker algebra, able to deal with such a feature allowing both transient and steady-state analyses. To motivate the actual need of marking dependency in {NMSPN} modeling and to demonstrate the potential of such a feature as well as the validity of the proposed solution technique a case study on a multi-core {CPU} system with power management facilities is explored.},

	abstract = {The widespread use of ecological network models (e.g., Ecopath, Econetwrk, and related energy budget models) has been laudable for several reasons, chief of which is providing an easy-to-use set of modeling tools that can present an ecosystem context for improved understanding and management of living marine resources ({LMR}). Yet the ease-of-use of these models has led to two challenges. First, the veritable explosion of the use and application of these network models has resulted in recognition that the content and use of such models has spanned a range of quality. Second, as these models and their application have become more widespread, they are increasingly being used in a {LMR} management context. Thus review panels and other evaluators of these models would benefit from a set of rigorous and standard criteria from which the basis for all network models and related applications for any given system (i.e., the initial, static energy budget) can be evaluated. To this end, as one suggestion for improving network models in general, here I propose a series of pre-balance ({PREBAL}) diagnostics. These {PREBAL} diagnostics can be done, now, in simple spreadsheets before any balancing or tuning is executed. Examples of these {PREBAL} diagnostics include biomasses, biomass ratios, vital rates, vital rate ratios, total production, and total removals (and slopes thereof) across the taxa and trophic levels in any given energy budget. I assert that there are some general ecological and fishery principles that can be used in conjunction with {PREBAL} diagnostics to identify issues of model structure and data quality before balancing and dynamic applications are executed.Ihumbly present {thisPREBAL} informationasasimple yet general approachthat could be easily implemented, could be considered for further incorporation into these model packages, and as such would ultimately result in a straightforward way to evaluate (and perhaps identify areas for improving) initial conditions in food web modeling efforts.© 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

This, however, creates a problem with quality assurance; to address this we provide an overview of best practices for creating Ecopath models. We describe the diagnostics that can be used to check for thermodynamic and ecological principles, and highlight principles that should be used for balancing a model. We then highlight the pitfalls when comparing Ecopath models using Ecological Network Analysis indices. For dynamic simulations in Ecosim we show the state of the art in calibrating the model by fitting it to time series using a formal fitting procedure and statistical goodness of fit. Finally, we show how Monte Carlo simulations can be used to address uncertainty in input parameters, and we discuss the use of models in a management context, specifically using the concept of 'key runs' for ecosystem-based management. This novel list of best practices for {EwE} models will enable ecosystem managers to evaluate the goodness of fit of the given {EwE} model to the ecosystem management question.},

	abstract = {In this review of sediment denitrification in estuaries and coastal ecosystems, we examine current denitrification measurement methodologies and the dominant biogeochemical controls on denitrification rates in coastal sediments. Integrated estimates of denitrification in coastal ecosystems are confounded by methodological difficulties, a lack of systematic understanding of the effects of changing environmental conditions, and inadequate attention to spatial and temporal variability to provide both seasonal and annual rates. Recent improvements in measurement techniques involving 15N techniques and direct N2 concentration changes appear to provide realistic rates of sediment denitrification. Controlling factors in coastal systems include concentrations of water column {NO}3/-, overall rates of sediment carbon metabolism, overlying water oxygen concentrations, the depth of oxygen penetration, and the presence/absence of aquatic vegetation and macrofauna. In systems experiencing environmental change, either degradation or improvement, the importance of denitrification can change. With the eutrophication of the Chesapeake Bay, the overall rates of denitrification relative to N loading terms have decreased, with factors such as loss of benthic habitat via anoxia and loss of submerged aquatic vegetation driving such effects.},

	abstract = {The combined culture of fed species (bivalves, fish) and macroalgae, known as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}), has been suggested as a method of mitigating localised nitrogen (N) increase from aquaculture, whilst simultaneously culturing macroalgae for commercial applications. The development of {IMTA} requires an understanding of the N ecophysiology of candidate macroalga species. We examined seasonal variations in ammonium ({NH}4+) uptake kinetics, carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio, pigment content and soluble tissue N of four macroalgae of the phylum Ochrophyta, Ecklonia radiata, Macrocystis pyrifera, Lessonia corrugata, and Phyllospora comosa, from Tasmania, Australia. This study aimed to determine, (1) if the N physiology of the four macroalgal species was suitable for {IMTA} applications and (2) whether the species had seasonal variations in N ecophysiology which would influence their suitability for {IMTA}. Macrocystis pyrifera, L. corrugata, and E. radiata exhibited saturable {NH}4+ uptake kinetics, with a maximum uptake rate (Vmax) during spring, summer and autumn of 200, 45.8 and 45 μmol {gDW}-1 h-1 and half-saturation constants (Ks) of 361.3, 104.2 and 121 μM, respectively. Phyllospora comosa exhibited biphasic uptake patterns for three out of four months sampled. There were no noticeable seasonal patterns in pigment content or soluble tissue N for any species. C:N ratios increased from spring (October) to autumn (March) in both E. radiata (28.34 – 47.83) and P. comosa (24.99 – 51.62), indicating progressive N limitation though summer and into autumn. Results suggest that M. pyrifera and P. comosa are most suitable for {IMTA} due to their high {NH}4+ uptake potential.},

The goal of this project was to develop a land-based system for the integrated culture of seaweeds and shellfish, to test the efficacy of integrated versus non-integrated designs, and to assess the potential for {IMTA} to mitigate the effects of climate change from ocean acidification on shellfish growth and physiology. We utilized the red abalone (Haliotis rufescens) and the red seaweed dulse (Devaleraea mollis) as our study species and designed integrated tanks at three different recirculation rates (0\%, 30\%, and 65\% recirculation per hour) to test how an integrated design would affect growth rates of the abalone and seaweeds, modify nutrient levels, and change water chemistry. We specifically hypothesized that {IMTA} designs would raise seawater {pH} to benefit calcifying species. Our results indicated that juvenile abalone grew significantly faster in weight (22\% increase) and shell area (11\% increase) in 6 months in tanks with the highest recirculation rates (65\%). The 65\% recirculation treatment also exhibited a significant increase in mean seawater {pH} (0.2 {pH} units higher) due to the biological activity of the seaweed in the connected tanks. We found a significant positive relationship between the mean {pH} of seawater in the tanks and juvenile abalone growth rates across all treatments. There were no significant differences in the growth of dulse among treatments, but dulse growth did vary seasonally. Seawater phosphate and nitrate concentrations were depleted in the highest recirculation rate treatment, but ammonium concentrations were elevated, likely due to the abalone effluent. Overall, our results indicate that there are benefits to {IMTA} culture of seaweeds and abalone in terms of improving growth in land-based systems, which will reduce the time to market and buffer commercial abalone operations against the effects of ocean acidification during vulnerable early life stages.},

However, the geographical distribution and controlling factors of marine N2 fixation remain elusive largely due to sparse observations. Here we present unprecedented high-resolution underway N2 fixation estimates across over 6000 kilometers of the western North Atlantic. Unexpectedly, we find increasing N2 fixation rates from the oligotrophic Sargasso Sea to North America coastal waters, driven primarily by cyanobacterial diazotrophs. N2 fixation is best correlated to phosphorus availability and chlorophyll-a concentration. Globally, intense N2 fixation activity in the coastal oceans is validated by a meta-analysis of published observations and we estimate the annual coastal N2 fixation flux to be 16.7 Tg N. This study broadens the biogeography of N2 fixation, highlights the interplay of regulating factors, and reveals thriving diazotrophic communities in coastal waters with potential significance to the global nitrogen and carbon cycles.},

	abstract = {Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) is being explored on both economic and environmental grounds in many traditional aquaculture regions. To test a variety of suitable macroalgae species and management scenarios, a numerical model is developed to quantify the remediation of dissolved nutrients and production of macroalgae near a nutrient source. Differences in the morphological, physiological, and economic characteristics of different macroalgae species can provide flexibility when considering the cost and benefit of farming macroalgae. Results show that of the three species studied, Macrocystis pyrifera removed 75 \% of dissolved inorganic nitrogen ({DIN}) input from a point source, while Porphyra umbilicalis and Ulva lactuca removed 5 \%. Both M. pyrifera and P. umbilicalis have reduced bioremediation capacity at increasing flow rates. U. lactuca showed increased bioremediation potential as flow rate increased from low to moderate flows. Increasing the optical depth increased the bioremediation potential of M. pyrifera for moderate values of the light attenuation coefficient, whereas bioremediation was unaffected by optical depth for both U. lactuca and P. umbilicalis. Harvesting increased bioremediation capacity of all species by up to 25-fold dependent on the establishment phase and harvesting frequency. We conclude that the choice of macroalgae species greatly affects the success of {IMTA} and that both harvesting and farm arrangements can be used to greatly optimize bioremediation.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is an increasingly expanding industry driven both by economic opportunity and necessity, as countries seek contemporary solutions to food security. However there are risks with unchecked or poorly managed expansion, including the potential to harm natural ecosystems in the vicinity of aquaculture farms. It is unknown exactly how sensitive estuarine biogeochemistry is to a major input of dissolved inorganic nitrogen ({DIN}) from finfish aquaculture. {DIN} is the limiting nutrient in autotrophic growth in temperate Australian estuaries, and increase in {DIN} loading has the potential to greatly increase primary phytoplankton production with possible consequences ranging from general decrease in water quality to harmful algal blooms and a trophic shift to eutrophication. The present work investigates the impact of salmon farming on the marine environment and key ecological processes in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel and Huon Estuary in Tasmania. This study uses purpose built ecosystem models to assess the increase of nutrients in the region due to the nutrient input from fish farms. The results indicate a need to develop strategies to deal with nutrient loading from salmon aquaculture, particularly if the industry were to increase production beyond current levels. One method gaining increasing interest worldwide is Integrated Multitrophic Aquaculture ({IMTA}) in which species that utilize the waste products from the primary species are farmed alongside the focus species. Here I construct an {IMTA} process model to identify the most suitable macroalgae, from a set of potential species for this region, and present a thorough uncertainty analysis of the model. The model is then used within larger estuary models to quantify the potential benefits of {IMTA} at the system level. The thesis comprises separate chapters for the General Introduction, General Conclusion and four standalone chapters that focus on quantifying the potential of using macroalgae as an agent for {IMTA} in conjunction with finfish aquaculture in southeast Tasmania},

	abstract = {This paper describes an application of {MOHID} modelling system to a shallow temperate coastal lagoon in Portugal's western coast (Ria de Aveiro), simulating more than one primary producer, for a better understanding of the existing ecological dynamics and creating a useful tool to delineate land activities management practices. {MOHID} water quality model is driven by a physical transport model and simulates the dynamics and productivity of the two main primary producers (phytoplankton and macroalgae) as well as the cycling of nitrogen, carbon and oxygen in interaction with sediment and hydrodynamics. The integrated model is forced by exchanges with the Atlantic Ocean (tide), atmosphere, and by sediment and nutrient inputs from the upstream rivers and other discharges. Focus is given to the light parameterization of primary production, influence of hydro and sediment dynamics and to the prediction of seaweed beds distribution. The results obtained show that the model is better adjusted to field data with macroalgae's simulation and that macroalgae can have an important role in primary production. Hydrodynamic conditions can be significant in the competition between the two primary producers, determining the predominant groups as well as their limiting factors. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A comparison with three other models was made on the basis of several criteria (simplicity and biological significance of parameters, applicability, quality of fit, minimum structural correlations and ease of determination of parameters). A detailed comparison of a 217-point data set, and an extensive comparison of 47 different data sets show that the new model is better than its competitors. The three cardinal temperatures were found to be independent of μopt. A very strong and unexpected linear correlation between the cardinal temperatures was observed.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to define the waste plume dynamics around a salmon farm in Norway. Systematic water sampling and numerical modeling were implemented to define nutrient concentrations in the upper water column at long-term (seasonal) and short-term (between and within days) time scales. Nutrient enhancement was observed for ammonium only, while the concentrations of orthophosphate and organic wastes were never higher than the background values. The spatial magnitude of cage effluent dispersion was limited. Empirical results detected enhanced concentrations up to 100 m down-current of the farm when fish biomass was high. Model results showed that the zone of influence could occasionally reach to {\textgreater} 1000 m. In the first year of production, when fish biomass was low, no enhancement was detected, and in April and September of the following year, average ammonium concentrations were respectively 0.2 and 0.8 μM above the background concentrations. Taking the ambient seasonal variability into account, this resulted in 1.6 times higher concentrations for both sampling months. The measured short-term temporal variability in nutrient concentrations near the cages varied up to 2 times from day to day and were 3.5 times higher in the evening compared to the morning. As seasonal investigations were performed in the morning, maximum enhancement was likely underestimated. The rapid decrease in nutrient concentrations with increasing distance from the cages suggests that the farm studied here is currently not causing significant degradation of surface water quality. Results of this study contribute to evaluating the potential for ecological mitigation of waste nutrients and provide directions for design of optimized integrated multi-trophic aquaculture facilities.},

Low concentrations of nitrate occurred during most of 1998 ({\textless} 3 μM) except in spring (4.8-18.8 μM). Experimental seeding with sporophylls and fertilizing the plants with a slow-release inorganic fertilizer produced successful recruitment when the water temperature was declining (18.7 °C). Survival of transplanted juveniles was significantly higher when fertilized during a period of particularly warm water and low nutrients in 1998 caused by El Niño. Analysis of tissue nitrogen suggests that plants were nutrient-limited during this period, and possibly affected synergistically by temperature stress. The results indicate that nutrients directly affect recruitment and survival of giant kelp at its southern limit, particularly during El Niño conditions.},

In the continuous flow experiments, the nitrogen content of the plants increased with the increased concentration of nitrate in the seawater. In the batch culture experiments, a lag period of 3–7 days often occurred before changes in the nitrogen supply were reflected in corresponding changes in the nitrogen content of the plants. Growth rates were a linear function of tissue nitrogen which varied between 1–3\% dry weight. Saturation of growth rate as a function of tissue nitrogen did not occur, although tissue nitrogen levels did saturate as a function of external nitrate supply. Juvenile M. pyrifera sporophytes do not appear to “store” nitrogen.

	abstract = {We tested the ability of sporophytes of a small kelp, Ecklonia radiata (C. Agardh) J. Agardh, to adjust their photosynthesis, respiration, and cellular processes to increasingly warm ocean climates along a latitudinal gradient in ocean temperature (∼4°C). Tissue concentrations of pigment and nutrients decreased with increasing ocean temperature. Concurrently, a number of gradual changes in the metabolic balance of E. radiata took place along the latitudinal gradient. Warm-acclimatized kelps had 50\% lower photosynthetic rates and 90\% lower respiration rates at the optimum temperature than did cool-acclimatized kelps. A reduction in temperature sensitivity was also observed as a reduction in Q 10-values from cool- to warm-acclimatized kelps for gross photosynthesis (Q 10: 3.35 to 1.45) and respiration (Q 10: 3.82 to 1.65). Respiration rates were more sensitive to increasing experimental temperatures (10\% higher Q 10-values) than photosynthesis and had a higher optimum temperature, irrespective of sampling location. To maintain a positive carbon balance, E. radiata increased the critical light demand (E c) exponentially with increasing experimental temperature. The temperature dependency of E c was, however, weakened with increasing ocean temperature, such that the critical light demand was relaxed in kelp acclimated to higher ocean temperatures. Nevertheless, calculations of critical depth limits suggested that direct effects of future temperature increases are unlikely to be as strong as effects of reduced water clarity, another globally increasing problem in coastal areas. © 2009 Phycological Society of America.},

The long term, or seasonal, component was consistent with large-scale storm-induced mixing and horizontal advection during winter months. In addition, vertical motions of the thermocline, bringing nutrients into the kelp forest, occurred throughout the year with a frequency of about 2 per day and were strongest during the summer months. High frequency sampling was required to resolve the pattern of nutrient input accurately. The major component of nutrient input came during the winter. These results indicate that nitrate limitation of M. pyrifera is a likely cause of reduced summer growth. Refs.},

To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of temperature (20, 26, 28, and 30 °C) and nitrogen conditions (seawater enriched with 25 \% {PESI} vs. non-enriched seawater) on photosynthesis, growth and survival, and nitrogen and chlorophyll a content of juvenile sporophytes (3–4 cm) along the coast of the Izu Peninsula, Japan. The juvenile sporophytes cultured in enriched medium showed significantly greater photosynthetic activity and relative growth rates than those cultured in non-enriched seawater at 20–28 °C, likely because of the much higher nitrogen and chlorophyll a content in the enriched medium. A significant effect of temperature on photosynthesis and relative growth rates was also detected under both nitrogen conditions. However, in contrast to the excellent survival exhibited in the enriched medium, dead juveniles were observed in non-enriched seawater at all temperatures, and survival rates decreased with increasing temperature. These results reveal that growth and survival of E. cava juvenile sporophytes are negatively affected by low nitrogen availability and high seawater temperature, which may result in deforestation of this kelp.},

	abstract = {Understanding the relative importance of environmental variables on growth and productivity of macroalgae is key to understanding how they might be influenced by environmental change. This study evaluates spatial and temporal patterns in growth and productivity of the kelp Ecklonia radiata in Marmion Lagoon (Western Australia) and tested how well these patterns could be explained by temperature, light, water movement and nutrient concentrations. Growth rates (thallus extension and productivity, measured as biomass accumulation and massstandardised biomass accumulation) varied between seasons, with the highest rates observed during spring, followed by summer. Temperature and light best explained spatial patterns in growth and productivity of E. radiata. Bottom water velocity and nutrient concentrations typically explained less of the variation, but in some cases they were well-correlated with patterns in productivity. Temperature was the best explanatory variable in summer, when higher water temperatures were associated with lower growth and productivity. Light explained patterns in growth and productivity during winter and spring, when light intensities were lower at some sites, especially at deeper offshore sites, than in summer. The repeated associations between temperature or light and patterns in thallus extension and biomass accumulation suggest that these 2 variables are the most important influences on growth and productivity of E. radiata in Marmion Lagoon. This inference is supported by the knowledge that these 2 variables strongly influence rates of photosynthesis. Our findings suggest that a sustained increase in temperature or reduction in light will reduce growth and productivity of E. radiata. Copyright © 2013 Inter-Research.},

	abstract = {Meristematic growth and loss of distal tissue from blades of two ecologically important species in the south-east Pacific, Lessonia nigrescens and Lessonia trabeculata, was evaluated during 1 year. Comparative growth was determined by a hole-punch method, loss of distal tissue from the blades was determined by subtracting final blade length (with loss) from expected blade lengths (without loss); growth and tissue loss were transformed to fresh biomass units for calculation of inter-algae differences. The results showed that blade elongation rate increased at the beginning of spring, and declined towards the end of summer, with mean values between 0.40 and 0.08 cm day-1 for L. nigrescens, and 0.65-0.17 cm day-1 for L. trabeculata. Loss of distal tissue varied seasonally when examined as length units for both species; with mean values between 0.24 and 0.10 cm day-1 for L. nigrescens, and 0.51-0.25 cm day-1 for L. trabeculata. Variations in fresh biomass units were only observed in Lessonia trabeculata, increasing in spring, with mean values to 0.13 g (fresh weight) day-1. Annual growth and loss of distal tissue were higher in L. trabeculata (0.41 and 0.39 cm day -1, respectively) than in L nigrescens (0.19 and 0.15 cm day -1). When growth and tissue loss were considered as fresh biomass, monthly gains significantly outweighed loss of distal tissue in both species, but parallel results based on length data followed a different trend. L. trabeculata released about 50\% of its growth biomass as particulate organic matter, while the comparative value for L. nigrescens was about 20\%. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Tissues of 338 marine macrophytes comprising 103 species, collected from the Atlantic, Mediterranean, South China, and Caribbean Seas, and encompassing a broad range in thallus form and pigmentation, were examined to quantify the importance of phylogenetic differences, spectral variability, and plant form and pigment content to account for differences in the absorption of light by marine macrophytes. Phylogenetic differences accounted for 2.5\% of the variance in absorption observed, non-phylogenetic spectral differences being much larger (26\%). Differences among individual specimens were much larger (72\%), absorption at 675 nm increasing non-linearly as chlorophyll a density1/2, indicating that light absorption increases with increasing chlorophyll a density following a law of diminishing returns, as predicted by theory. The energy return per unit tissue produced (i.e. light absorption per unit plant weight) increased linearly with increasing chlorophyll a concentration. However, the light absorbed per unit weight decreased, for a given chlorophyll a concentration, as plant thickness increased. This indicates that while increasing thickness may increase chlorphyll a density and, hence, the light absorbed by marine macrophyte thalli, this strategy represents a burden limiting potential carbon turnover and plant growth. These results indicate that the diverse repertoire of light absorption by marine macrophytes can be adequately modeled as a continuum, dependent on plant thickness and pigment content, independent of phylogenetic differences. © 1994 Springer Verlag.},

More than ten species are commercially used to produce phycocolloids, fertilizers, plant growth control products, human food or animal fodder and feed additives. These multiple uses of algae offer a number of possibilities for coupling this activity to salmon, abalone and filter-feeder farming. In this context, different experiments carried out in Chile have demonstrated that Gracilaria chilensis and Macrocystis pyrifera have great potential in the development of an integrated aquaculture strategy. The present Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture ({IMTA}) approach study showed that Gracilaria can be cultured best at 1 m depth whereas Macrocystis has an especially good growth response at 3 m depth. Both species use available nitrogen efficiently. On the other hand, high intensities of solar radiation ({UV} and {PAR}) can be critical at low depths of cultivation, and our results indicate that both species show photosynthetic susceptibility mainly at noon during the summer. The demand of Macrocystis for abalone feeding is increasing, thus improving the opportunity for developing an integrated nutrient waste recycling activity in Chile. Although Gracilaria shows a higher nitrogen uptake capacity than Macrocystis, its market value does not yet allow a massive commercial scaling. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Macroalgae, especially habitat-forming species like kelp, play critical roles in temperate coastal ecosystems. However, their abundance and distribution patterns have been negatively affected by warming in many regions around the globe. Along with global change, coastal ecosystems are also impacted by local drivers such as eutrophication. The interaction between global and local drivers might modulate kelp responses to environmental change. This study examines the regulatory effect of no3 − on the thermal plasticity of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera. To do this, thermal performance curves ({TPCs}) of key temperature-dependant traits–growth, photosynthesis, {NO}3 − assimilation and chlorophyll a fluorescence–were examined under nitrate replete and deplete conditions in a short-term incubation. We found that thermal plasticity was modulated by {NO}3 − but different thermal responses were observed among traits. Our study reveals that nitrogen, a local driver, modulates kelp responses to high seawater temperatures, ameliorating the negative impacts on physiological performance (i.e. growth and photosynthesis). However, this effect might be species-specific and vary among biogeographic regions – thus, further work is needed to determine the generality of our findings to other key temperate macroalgae that are experiencing temperatures close to their thermal tolerance due to climate change.},

Frond elongation rates decreased significantly during the third week, and plant growth rate (wet wt) dropped from an initial inshore rate of 3.6 to 0.9\% d -1. During this 3 wk period, nitrogen contents and free amino acid concentrations decreased, while mannitol and dry contents increased in frond tissues. After depletion of internal nitrogen reserves, the nitrogen content of lamina and stipe tissues averaged 1.1 and 0.7\% drywt, respec-tively. The experimental plant was exposed to higher ambient nitrogen concentrations during the last 2 wk. Rates of frond elongation and plant growth increased, but nitrogen content and amino acids in frond tissues re-mained low. Of the total nitrogen contained in frond tissue of the plant before transplantation, 58\% was used to sup-port growth in the absence of significant external nitrogen supply. Amino acids constituted a small proportion of these internai nitrogen reserves. Net movement of nitrogen occurred within large fronds, but not between different frond size classes. The nitrogen content of holdfast tissue remained relatively constant at 2.4\% dry wt and accounted for 18 to 29\% of the total nitrogen. Holdfast nitrogen was not used to support growth of nitrogen-depleted fronds. In comparison to Laminaria longicruris, which is adapted to long seasonal periods of low nitrogen availability, M. pyrifera has small nitrogen-storage capacity. However, internal reserves of M. pyrifera appear adequate to make nitrogen starvation uncommon in southern California kelp forests.},

	abstract = {A mature closed-canopy forest of Ecklonia radiata (C. Ag.) J. Agardh at a depth of 1.5 m was studied over a period of 18 months. Growth of the primary frond was assayed using a punched-hole technique, with bimonthly sampling. Tagged plants were harvested and measurements made on age, growth, size, and dry weight ({DW}) of stipe and frond. Each frond was cut into 5-cm strips and the dry weight obtained. Surface area measurements were obtained in the late autumn and late spring. Extension growth of the primary frond was lowest in summer (7.6 mm · day−1) and showed a period of high activity from July (17.1 mm · day−1) to September (19.6 mm · day−1). The size and mass of the whole frond lagged behind the growth of the primary frond reaching a maximum in November or December (mean dry wt 99 g; length 46.3 cm; surface area, 7216 cm2). It is possible, therefore, that growth of lateral meristems continued after the period of maximum growth of the primary meristem. Disregarding this possibility of error in mean growth rate and using the data on extension of the primary frond and the mean biomass of the mature regions of the frond, production varied from a minimum in May (0.27 g {DW} · plant−1 · day−1) to a maximum in September (0.50 g {DW} · plant−1 · day−1). For a mean density of mature plants in the community of 22.5 · m−2, these values lead to a primary production rate of 3.1 kg {DW} · m−2 · yr−1 which is similar to values found in other kelps. A second method for measuring production is suggested, which takes into account the lag in growth of secondary fronds. This method yields a similar annual mean primary production rate of 2.9 kg {DW} · m−2 · yr−1 but leads to higher values in spring and lower values in autumn than the first method.},

Based on specific literature, a two-step kinetic scheme is selected for modelling growth and uptake of nitrogen and, therefore, the intratissual concentration of nitrogen has been considered as a state variable of the model. Accordingly, Ulva r. growth rate depends on the concentration of phosphorus in the external medium and on the intratissual nitrogen concentration, which influences, in turn, the uptake rates of reduced and oxidized nitrogen. The influences of temperature and light intensity on Ulva r. photosynthetic activity are also discussed. The dynamics of dissolved oxygen has also been modelled and a specific mortality rate, depending on dissolved oxygen, has been adopted. The model has proved to be qualitatively consistent with the available literature, while a first parametrization yields results in quantitative agreement with short term laboratory experiments, regarding samples collected in the lagoon of Venice. The model has been applied to data sets collected in the lagoon of Venice and is capable of reproducing the main features of the seasonal dynamic of Ulva r. These results prompted its inclusion in a comprehensive 3D transport-water quality model of the Venice lagoon ecosystem.},

In response to this threat, different strategies for buffering the impact of ocean cidification have been proposed. As the {pHexperienced} by individual corals on a natural reef system depends on many processes ver different time scales, the efficacy of these buffering strategies remains largely unknown. Here we assess the feasibility nd potential efficacy of a reef-scale (a few kilometers) carbon removal strategy, through the addition of seaweed (fleshy ulticellular algae) farms within the Great Barrier Reef at the Heron Island reef. First, using diagnostic time-dependent age racers in a hydrodynamic model, we determine the optimal location and size of the seaweed farm. Secondly, we analytically alculate the optimal densityof the seaweed and harvesting strategy, finding, for the seaweed growth parameters used, a iomass of 42 {gNm}-2 with a harvesting rate of up 3.2 {gNm}-2 d-1 maximises the carbon sequestration and removal. Numerical xperiments show that an optimally located 1.9 km2 farm and optimally harvested seaweed (removing biomass above 42 {gNm}-2 every ) increased aragonite saturation by 0.1 over 24 km2 of the Heron Island reef. Thus, the most effective seaweed farm can only elay the impacts of global ocean acidification at the reef scale by 7-21 years, depending on future global carbonemissions. ur results highlight that only a kilometer-scale farm can partially mitigate global ocean acidification for a particular eef.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture in many countries around the world has become the biggest source of seafood for human consumption. While it alleviates the pressure on wild capture fisheries, the long-term impacts of large-scale, intensive aquaculture on natural coastal systems need to be better understood. In particular, aquaculture may alter habitat and exceed the carrying capacity of coastal marine ecosystems. In this paper, we develop a high-resolution numerical model for Sanggou Bay, one of the largest kelp and shellfish aquaculture sites in Northern China, to investigate the effects of aquaculture on nutrient transport and residence time in the bay. Drag from aquaculture is parameterized for surface infrastructure, kelp canopies, and bivalve cages. A model for dissolved inorganic nitrogen ({DIN}) includes transport, vertical turbulent mixing, sediment and bivalve sources, and a sink due to kelp uptake. Test cases show that, due to drag from the dense aquaculture and thus a reduction of horizontal transport, kelp production is limited because {DIN} from the Yellow Sea is consumed before reaching the interior of the kelp farms. Aquaculture drag also causes an increase in the nutrient residence time from an average of 5 to 10 days in the middle of Sanggou Bay, and from 25 to 40 days in the shallow inner bay. Low exchange rates and a lack of {DIN} uptake by kelp make these regions more susceptible to phytoplankton blooms due to high nutrient retention. The risk is further increased when {DIN} concentrations rise due to river inflows.},

	abstract = {Marine farm structures cause drag, which can affect currents over large areas. This study uses numerical modelling to consider the effect of long-line mussel farms on tidal currents within embayments. The modelling illustrates how currents can be altered over most of a bay by farms that occupy a relatively small (10\%) proportion of the bay. The effect of several small farms located around a bay perimeter are compared to that of a large farm of equivalent area placed in different parts of the bay. While results show that current speeds are reduced in most places, particularly inside farms, different farm locations may increase velocities in some parts of a bay. Changes in currents caused by farm drag have an important influence on potential seston depletion, which is simulated using a tracer released from farmed areas. A simple decay rate is used to simulate plankton regrowth and seston replenishment. The depth-averaged modelling is based on 2 neighbouring bays: Port Ligar and Waihinau Bay, in the Pelorus Sound, New Zealand. Existing mussel farms in these bays occupy 10\% of the area of each bay and are located near ({\textless} 400 m) to shore, forming a broken ribbon around the perimeter of each bay. Existing farms reduce mean current speeds by an average of 7\% in Port Ligar and 3\% in Waihinau Bay. The difference is attributed to the different aspect ratios of the 2 bays. Neglecting farm drag results in over-predicting dispersal and under-predicting the degree of depletion within farms. At both sites, seston depletion is least likely to occur in farms placed in the outer parts of bays where currents are faster.},

	abstract = {Around 3000 Ha of New Zealand's coastal waters are presently allocated to mussel farming of the Greenshell mussel Perna canaliculus mainly in small inshore farms of 30 000 to 80 000 m2 each. The farms are constructed from blocks of parallel moored long-lines, with loops of spat-impregnated line hanging vertically in the upper 10-15 m of the water column (provided sufficient water depth). When fully laden, the mussel loops can present a rough diameter of 0.20 m or more to the flow. Industry expansion is likely to be in the form of larger offshore farms. Some of the larger proposed farms will have more than 1000 km of mussel line. This presents a potentially significant drag to currents and waves. In this paper, observations are used from one of the first large offshore farms constructed in New Zealand, in conjunction with scaling estimates of energy loss, to investigate the effect of the farm on waves, currents, and stratification. The farm, consisting of 230 long-lines arranged into 20 blocks, measured 650 m × 2450 m. The hanging mussel loops at this site reached an average depth of 8 m, and water depth at midtide varied across the site from 10-12 m. Transects were taken through the farm using both conductivity, temperature, depth ({CTD}), and Acoustic Doppler Profiler ({ADP}) instruments. A second {ADP} was moored inside the farm providing velocity time series. The average current was reduced within the farm by 36\%-63\%. The moored {ADP} detected an undercurrent beneath the farm with velocities nearly twice that within the farm. Sharp changes in stratification coincide with the start of fully stocked mussel long-lines. Furthermore, other than at the very upstream end of the farm, stratification appears to have prevented significant vertical mixing between the fluid within the farm and that flowing under the farm. Wave energy was low during the 7-d deployment, with significant wave heights peaking at 0.25 m. The attenuation of transitional waves through the farm is examined by comparing simultaneous pressure sensor measurements from offshore and inshore of the farm. The observations show that wave energy attenuation was frequency dependent. Observed wave energy attenuation across the 650 m wide farm was approximately 5\%, 10\%, and 17\% at wave frequencies of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.25 Hz, respectively. © 2005 {IEEE}.},

	abstract = {Two sister orders of the brown macroalgae (class Phaeophyceae), the morphologically complex Laminariales (commonly referred to as kelp) and the morphologically simple Ectocarpales are natural hosts for the {dsDNA} phaeoviruses (family Phycodnaviridae) that persist as proviruses in the genomes of their hosts. We have previously shown that the major capsid protein ({MCP}) and {DNA} polymerase concatenated gene phylogeny splits phaeoviruses into two subgroups, A and B (both infecting Ectocarpales), while {MCP}-based phylogeny suggests that the kelp phaeoviruses form a distinct third subgroup C. Here we used {MCP} to better understand the host range of phaeoviruses by screening a further 96 and 909 samples representing 11 and 3 species of kelp and Ectocarpales, respectively. Sporophyte kelp samples were collected from their various natural coastal habitats spanning five continents: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and South America. Our phylogenetic analyses showed that while most of the kelp phaeoviruses, including one from Macrocystispyrifera, belonged to the previously designated subgroup C, new lineages of Phaeovirus in 3 kelp species, Ecklonia maxima, Ecklonia radiata, Undaria pinnatifida, grouped instead with subgroup A. In addition, we observed a prevalence of 26\% and 63\% in kelp and Ectocarpales, respectively. Although not common, multiple phaeoviral infections per individual were observed, with the Ectocarpales having both intra- and inter-subgroup phaeoviral infections. Only intra-subgroup phaeoviral infections were observed in kelp. Furthermore, prevalence of phaeoviral infections within the Ectocarpales is also linked to their exposure to waves. We conclude that phaeoviral infection is a widely occurring phenomenon in both lineages, and that phaeoviruses have diversified with their hosts at least since the divergence of the Laminariales and Ectocarpales.},

Examples of suspended canopies include those formed by aquaculture structures or floating vegetation. The major difference between suspended canopies and the more common submerged canopies, which are located on the bottom boundary, is the influence of the bottom boundary layer beneath the suspended canopy. Data from laboratory experiments are presented which explore aspects of the flow through and beneath suspended canopies constructed from rigid cylinders. The experiments, using both acoustic Doppler and two-dimensional (2D) particle tracking velocimetry, give details of the flow structure that may be divided vertically into a bottom boundary layer, a canopy shear layer, and an internal canopy layer. The experimental data show that the penetration of the shear layer into the canopy is limited by the distance between the canopy and bottom boundary layer. Peaks in velocity spectra indicate an interaction between the bottom boundary and canopy shear layer. An analytical model is also developed that can be used to calculate a drag coefficient that includes the effect of both canopy drag and bed friction. This drag coefficient is suitable for use in 2D (depth-averaged) hydrodynamic modeling. The model also allows the average velocity within and beneath the canopy to be calculated, and is used to investigate the effect of canopy density and thickness on both total drag and bottom friction. © 2011 {ASCE}.},

	abstract = {In conditions of low water motion ({\textless}0.06 ms-1), the availability of essential nutrients to macroalgae, and thus their potential productivity, may be limited by thick diffusion boundary-layers at the thallus surface. The ability of macroalgae to take up nutrients in slow moving water may be related to how their blade morphology affects diffusion boundary-layer- thickness. For the giant kelp, Macrocystis integrifolia Bory, morphological measurements indicate that blades of plants from a site exposed to wave action are thick, narrow and have a heavily corrugated surface. In contrast, blades from a site with a low degree of water motion are relatively thin, with few surface corrugations and large undulations along their edges. The aim of our work was to test the hypothesis that morphological features of M. integrifolia blades from a sheltered site allow enhanced inorganic nitrogen uptake at low seawater velocities compared to blades with a wave-exposed morphology. The rate of nitrate and ammonium uptake by morphologically distinct blades of M. integrifolia, from sites that were sheltered from and exposed to wave action, were measured in the laboratory at a range of seawater velocities (0.01 to 0.16 ms-1), between March and May 1993. For both sheltered and exposed blade morphologies, nitrate and ammonium uptake rates increased with increasing sea-water velocity, reaching a maximum rate at 0.04 to 0.06 ms-1. Uptake parameters V(max) (maximum uptake rate) and U(0.37) (the velocity at which the uptake rate is 37\% of the maximum rate) were estimated using an exponential decay formula. These parameters were similar for both blade morphologies, at all seawater velocities tested. Additional measurements suggest that the nitrogen status of M. integrifolia blades from wave-sheltered and exposed sites were similar throughout the experimental period, and thus nitrogen status did not affect the rate of nitrogen uptake in these experiments. On the basis of these results, we conclude that blade morphology does not enhance nitrogen uptake by M. integrifolia in conditions of low water motion. Potential effects of diffusion boundary-layers on kelp productivity are discussed.},

	abstract = {Hydrodynamic forces dislodge and kill large numbers of organisms in intertidal and subtidal habitats along rocky shores. Although this feature of wave-driven water motion is well recognized, the mechanics of force imposition on compliant organisms is incompletely understood. Here we undertake a field examination of two processes that are thought to impose many of the more dangerous forces that act on flexible benthic seaweeds: impingement of breaking waves directly on emergent organisms, and inertial effects tied to the rapid deceleration of mass that occurs when a passively moving but attached organism abruptly reaches the extent of its range of motion. We focus on two common and important seaweed species: one intertidal kelp (Egregia menziesii) and one subtidal kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). Results support the concept that wave impingement and inertial effects produce intermittent force transients whose magnitudes commonly exceed values readily attributable to drag. Peak force transients are elevated by as much as a factor of 3 relative to drag in both small and large individuals, consistent with smaller seaweeds being more susceptible to brief impingement forces, and larger seaweeds being more vulnerable to inertial forces. Because both wave impingement and inertial effects vary with the size of an organism, they may have the potential to influence the demographics of physical disturbance in an array of flexible species. © 2008 Marine Biological Laboratory.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Since the mid 1990s, Australia's Commonwealth Science Industry and Research Organisation ({CSIRO}) has developed a biogeochemical ({BGC}) model for coupling with a hydrodynamic and sediment model for application in estuaries, coastal waters and shelf seas. The suite of coupled models is referred to as the {CSIRO} Environmental Modelling Suite ({EMS}) and has been applied at tens of locations around the Australian continent. At a mature point in the {BGC} model's development, this paper presents a full mathematical description, as well as links to the freely available code and User Guide. The mathematical description is structured into processes so that the details of new parameterisations can be easily identified, along with their derivation. The {EMS} {BGC} model cycles carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous and oxygen through multiple phytoplankton, zooplankton, detritus and dissolved organic and inorganic forms in multiple water column and sediment layers. The underwater light field is simulated by a spectrally-resolved optical model that includes the calculation of water-leaving reflectance for validation with remote sensing. The water column is dynamically coupled to the sediment to resolve deposition, resuspension and benthic-pelagic biogeochemical fluxes. With a focus on shallow waters, the model also includes particularly-detailed representations of benthic plants such as seagrass, macroalgae and coral polyps. A second focus has been on, where possible, the use of geometric derivations of physical limits to constrain ecological rates, which generally requires population-based rates to be derived from initially considering the size and shape of individuals. For example, zooplankton grazing considers encounter rates of one predator on a prey field based on summing relative motion of the predator with the prey individuals and the search area, chlorophyll synthesis includes a geometrically-derived self-shading term, and the bottom coverage of benthic plants is generically-related to their biomass using an exponential form derived from geometric arguments. This geometric approach has led to a more algebraically-complicated set of equations when compared to more empirical biogeochemical model formulations. But while being algebraically-complicated, the model has fewer unconstrained parameters and is therefore simpler to move between applications than it would otherwise be. The version of the biogeochemistry described here is implemented in the {eReefs} project that is delivering a near real time coupled hydrodynamic, sediment and biogeochemical simulation of the Great Barrier Reef, northeast Australia, and its formulation provides an example of the application of geometric reasoning in the formulation of aquatic ecological processes.},

Benthic organisms maintain upright postures in the water column by one of two mechanisms, stiffness or buoyancy. Turbinaria ornata is a tropical macroalga that uses either buoyancy or flexural stiffness ({EI}), depending on its flow habitat. This study used physical models of T. ornata to compare the effect of different magnitudes of these two mechanisms on relative water velocity and hydrodynamic forces in both unidirectional and wavy flow. Models of the alga were constructed to span and exceed natural levels of T. ornata's {EI} and buoyancy. Models with high {EI} and high buoyancy maintained upright postures in both unidirectional flow and waves, and experienced higher forces than models with low {EI} and moderate or low buoyancy that deflected in the direction of water motion. In waves, buoyant models that were deflected by high velocity rebounded back into upright positions when the flow slowed. Non-buoyant, flexible models were also pushed over by flow but lacked the ability to rebound upright, which led to decreased force in unidirectional flow, but high force in waves.},

The study area was divided into four boxes according to similarities in the hydrological environment and aquaculture layout. Scenario simulations were conducted with different combinations of oyster and kelp seeding densities to examine the environmental impacts and production under different aquaculture layouts. Results showed that the model could capture the main characteristics of observed environmental variables and culture organism growth. Increased seeding density of both oysters and kelp generally leads to increased production with diminished individual growth. Kelp aquaculture plays a leading role in the nutrient cycle in the bay, acting as a large reception tank during the rapid growth period. The model results indicate that there is still potential to increase production for both oyster and kelp in Sanggou bay. The current aquaculture practice seems to have the right balance of carrying capacity, management efforts, and other costs under the existing production procedures. The ecosystem model is a promising tool for further study with sustained observation effort and better boundary conditions.},

For management of aquaculture farms, a biophysical model was developed to quantify the potential influence of bivalves-seaweed integrated culture on pelagic ecosystem. We developed {NEMURO}.{CULTURE} model by coupling the cultivated species (kelp Laminaria japonica, oyster Crassostrea gigas, scallop Chlamys farreri) and phosphorus-related variables with {NEMURO} (North Pacific Ecosystem Model for Understanding Regional Oceanography). The entire culture area of Sungo Bay was divided into five boxes according to the culture layout (kelp monoculture areas (K-area), co-culture areas (K\&O-area), scallop monoculture areas (S-area), oyster monoculture areas (O-area), fish culture areas (F-area), and no-culture areas (Boundary)). The application of the model to the integrated culture system in Sungo Bay has shown promising results as the simulations reasonably agreed with the observations. The model was then used for scenario simulations to analyse the impact of mariculture. The simulation results showed that: 1) the concentration of phytoplankton and nutrients was largely constrained by cultivated kelps during the late stage of kelp culture period, while the influence of cultivated bivalves was relatively small; 2) the influence of cultivated kelps and bivalves could be transported to neighbor areas and weakened in the K-area, while the influence of cultivated fishes was confined near F-area; 3) the integrated culture of shellfish and seaweed in Sungo Bay would reduce the risk of eutrophication in spring; 4) the addition of phosphorus-related variables enabled the model to depict more details and phosphorus could be the limiting factor for phytoplankton growth at some time in Sungo Bay.

	abstract = {This study evaluates the ecosystem structure and function of the nearshore reefs in the Lidao coastal ecosystem of northern China, a region of intensive kelp aquaculture, and fisheries enhancements, including the deployment of artificial reefs and release of cultured marine species. An Ecopath model, with 20 functional groups representing 81 species, was developed for a representative area in the region and Ecosim was used to explore two scenarios for alternative fishing practices and surrounding aquaculture activities. The mean trophic levels ({TLs}) of the functional groups ranged from 1.0 for the primary producers (phytoplankton, benthic algae and seagrass) and detritus to 4.14 for Type {III} fishes (fishes found in the water column above the artificial reefs, e.g., Scomberomorus niphonius). The mean transfer efficiency through the whole system was 11.7\%, and the ecosystem had a relative low maturity, stability and disturbance resistance, indicating that it was at a developing stage. Nearly half of the total system biomass (48.9\% of 620.20 t km−2 year−1), excluding detritus, was comprised of benthic finfish and invertebrates. The total yield from all fisheries (86.82 t/km2/year) was dominated by low trophic level herbivorous and detritivorous species, such as the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus ({TL} = 2.1, 46.07\%), other echinoderms (sea urchins Asterias amurensis and Strongylocentrotus nudus, {TL} = 2.1, 34.6\%) and abalone Haliotis discus hannai ({TL} = 2.0, 18.4\%), and as a consequence, the mean {TL} of the catch was low (2.1). The results from the Ecosim simulation of closing all fisheries for 20 years predicted an increase of about 100\% in the relative biomass of the main exploited species, A. japonicus and H. discus hannai. The simulated removal of all kelp farms over 10 years resulted in a two fold increase in the relative biomass of Type {III} fishes and a 120\% increase in their main prey (i.e. Small pelagic fish), while the relative biomass of A. japonicus and Heterotrophic bacteria decreased by 31.4\% and 12.7\%, respectively. These predictions indicate that nearshore kelp cultivation favours benthic, rather than water column production, and is likely to be providing energy subsidies for the stock enhancement of benthic species in this region.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional physical-biological coupled aquaculture model is developed to study the aquaculture carrying capacity of kelp in Sungo Bay, a typical aquaculture site in China with intensive suspended raft aquaculture. In the aquaculture model, the hydrodynamic module builds on the Princeton Ocean Model by adding two types of drags due to the aquaculture facilities at surface and kelp in water column. The biological module simulates the renewal of dissolved inorganic nitrogen ({DIN}), the cycle of phytoplankton biomass, and the growth of kelp, while the contribution of bivalves' excretion to {DIN} is set to a constant derived from observations. Thus, the coupling between the growth of kelp and the current variation can be studied by adding drags in the layers reached by kelp. The simulated magnitude and vertical profile of currents agree well with observations. The suspended aquaculture causes a reduction in the average speed of surface current by 40\%, decreasing the water exchange with the open sea. The simulation results also show that the seasonal and spatial variations of the {DIN} concentration and phytoplankton biomass are clearly controlled by the distributions of different species. The estimation of {DIN} budgets of different periods shows competition between kelp and phytoplankton. The primary source of nutrients for the growth of kelp in Sungo Bay is the {DIN} from the open sea, and the aquaculture obstruction is the main reason for the deficient {DIN} in the kelp culture area. The final kelp production decreases from the mouth to the end of the bay, consistent with the spatial variation of water exchange rate. Numerical experiments have been carried out by increasing the aquaculture density of kelp from 0.8 to 1.5 times of the current value. Obtained results indicate that the optimal average density is 0.9 times of the current value. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

A multiple box ecosystem model for {GEL} tied to the output of a hydrodynamic model was constructed using Simile software, which has inherent ability to represent spatial elements and specify water exchange between modelled regions. Mussel growth and other field data were used for model validation. Plackett-Burman sensitivity analysis demonstrated that a variety of bioenergetic parameters of zooplankton and phytoplankton submodels were important in model outcomes. Model results demonstrated that mussel aquaculture can be further developed throughout the lagoon. At present culture densities, phytoplankton depletion is minimal, and there is little food limitation of mussel growth. Results indicated that increased stocking density of mussels in the existing farm will lead to decreased mass per individual mussel. Depending on the location of new farm emplacement within the lagoon, implementation of new aquaculture sites either reduced mussel growth in the existing farm due to depletion of phytoplankton, or exhibited minimum negative impact on the existing farm. With development throughout {GEL}, an excess of phytoplankton was observed during the year in all modelled regions, even at stocking densities as high as 20 mussels m-3. Although mussels cultured at this density do not substantially impact the ecosystem, their growth is controlled by the flux of phytoplankton food and abundance of zooplankton competitors. This model provides an effective tool to examine expansion of shellfish farming to new areas, balancing culture location and density. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Coastal eutrophication and its associated harmful algal blooms have emerged as one of the most severe environmental problems worldwide. Seaweed cultivation has been widely encouraged to control eutrophication and algal blooms. Among them, cultivated kelp (Saccharina japonica) dominates primarily by production and area. However, the responses of water quality and phytoplankton community to kelp farming remain unclear. Here, thirteen cruises were conducted in the kelp farms and control areas in the turbid, highly eutrophic Xiangshan Bay of the East China Sea from 2008 to 2015. Results indicated that kelp cultivation slightly increased dissolved oxygen and {pH}, but reduced dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. We estimated that kelp harvesting would remove 297 t of nitrogen and 42 t of phosphorus from this bay annually. Because of decreased flow velocity, turbulence, and sediment resuspension, kelp farming greatly reduced suspended solids and increased transparency, resulting in increases in phytoplankton chlorophyll a and abundance. Additionally, kelp farming appreciably increased phytoplankton species number, Marglef richness, and Shannon–Wiener diversity indices by 51.6\%, 40.1\%, and 13.1\%, respectively. Analysis of similarity and similarity percentages demonstrated that phytoplankton community composition differed significantly between the farm and control area, which was mostly attributed to long-chained diatoms and single-celled dinoflagellates. However, after the kelp harvesting, all measurements of water quality and phytoplankton biomass, diversity, and community composition exhibited no significant difference. Our study highlights that kelp cultivation alleviates eutrophication and acidification and enhances phytoplankton diversity, thus providing guidance for macroalgal aquaculture and remediation in eutrophic waters.},

	abstract = {Finfish aquaculture is an activity that has experienced an explosive global development, but presents several environmental risks, such as high nitrogen outputs with potential eutrophication consequences. Therefore, the integration of seaweed aquaculture with the aim of decreasing nitrogen emissions associated with intensive salmon farming has been proposed as a bioremediation solution. Ecophysiological knowledge about seaweeds cultured close to farming cages is, however, still rudimentary. We experimentally studied the growth and physiological responses of Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) C. Agardh in a suspended culture system near a commercial salmon farm at three culture depths in order to understand its productivity performance. The results showed maximum growth responses at intermediate depths (3 m) as opposed to near the surface (1 m) or at a deeper culture level (6 m). At 6 m depth, light limitations were detected, whereas the sporophytes growing at 1 m depth responded to high irradiances, especially in late spring and summer, where they were more intensely exposed to decay of photosynthesis than individuals from other depths. Accordingly, photosynthetic pigment concentrations (chlorophyll a and c, and fucoxonthin) were higher during low-light seasons (winter and early spring) but decreased during the summer. On the other hand, although both nitrogen uptake and Nitrate Reductase ({NR}) activity varied seasonally, increasing significantly in spring and summer, these variables were not affected by culture depth. Therefore, the optimal culture depth of M. pyrifera near salmon farms appears to be a physiological integration between nitrogen supply and demand, which is modulated by plant acclimation to the seasonal change in light and temperature. The results allow to discuss about the environmental constrains of M. pyrifera in an ecophysiological context to improve the understanding of its aquaculture, and to contribute relevant information on the use of this species in bioremediation.},

	abstract = {The current work aimed to develop a cultivation method for macroalgae that can be applicable and economically profitable in the Atlantic Ocean. An offshore long-line macroalgal cultivation rig was designed by Ocean Rainforest Sp/f, tested in the Faroe Islands from 2010, and found suitable for cultivation in exposed and deep-water locations (water depth {\textgreater} 50 m). The economic risk related to lost cultivation structures was hereafter considered to be low. Saccharina latissima and Alaria esculenta were cultivated in commercial scale (5 km of growth lines). A high cost of seeding material and cost of deployment was reduced by testing multiple partial harvesting. Four non-destructive harvests were carried out in a two-year growth period without re-seeding of lines. In total, 3.2 t dry weight (dw) biomass was harvested and sold to customers within the food and cosmetic industries. The productivity was 1437.5 kg dw ha(-1) yr(-1) (including handling space). The 10-meter vertical growth lines had an average yield of 0.29 kg dwm(-1) per harvest and four partial harvests were made over a 2-year period. An economic analysis showing the cost structure of important aspects of offshore macroalgae cultivation was conducted. The total cost per kg dw of cultivated S. latissima decreased when the number of possible harvests without re-seeding was increased (from (sic) 36.73 to (sic) 9.27). This work has demonstrated that large-scale kelp cultivation is possible using multiple partial harvesting in the Faroe Islands, and highlighted the need for further innovation to lower the cost per unit macroalgal produced.},

	abstract = {The interest to develop an industrialized cultivation of several macroalgae in Europe is growing rapidly. Here, we demonstrate cultivation of the sugar kelp Saccharina latissima in integration with salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture in a Norwegian coastal area. Sporophytes of S. latissima were deployed at 2, 5 and 8. m depths at a salmon farm and at a reference station 4. km away in August, November, February and June (2010-2011). The growth was good in late autumn and in spring, with peak lengths of the sporophytes in June, while being poor in winter and summer. As a result of a faster initial growth at the fish farm than at the reference station from August to November, the August-sporophytes reached a significantly longer length than those at the reference station in 5 out of 10 sampling months at 2. m depth, and in 9 out of 10. months at 5. m depth (p. {\textless}. 0.05) over the year, while no significantly different lengths were found at 8. m depth. The November-sporophytes showed similar growth rates and lengths at the fish farm and at the reference station, while the February-sporophytes grew faster at 5 and 8. m depths at the fish farm than at the reference station, with significantly longer blades at 5. m depth at the fish farm than at the reference station at peak lengths in June (p. {\textless}. 0.05). The sporophytes deployed in June did not survive the summer. Holding the rapid growth of S. latissima in spring and early summer together with the increase in salmon biomass and feed use in late summer and early autumn suggested a seasonal mismatch considering direct recycling of the nutrient input from salmon farming by macroalgae in Norwegian coastal waters. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Enhanced growth and yields of Palmaria palmata and Saccharina latissima cultures were found when grown adjacent to fish farm cages. Growth rates in summer for P. palmata and S. latissima were enhanced by up to 48\% and 61\%, respectively, and biomass yields over a growth season were enhanced by 63\% and 27\%, respectively. The nitrogen content of the macroalgae grown close to the fish cages was greater than for those grown at reference sites away from the cages. Extrapolation show that under optimal conditions, a hectare of P. palmata could yield up to 180. tonnes wet weight per annum and a hectare of S. latissima 220. tonnes wet weight per annum. Conservative estimates of yields show that P. palmata could be expected to remove up to 12\% and S. latissima 5\% of the waste nitrogen released during the growth of 500. tonnes of salmon in the sea over 2. years. The practicalities and logistics of culturing macroalgae near fish cages are considered and, because of the wide distribution of nitrogen emanating from fish culture and the need to optimise growth conditions for cultured macroalgae, it is recommended that macroalgal culture for bioremediation should be considered at wider geographical scales i.e., bay wide at least. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The performance of deposit feeders in integratedmulti-trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) was analysed through the application of mathematical models. Loading of organic particulates to the benthos as a result of finfish cage culture and shellfish suspended culture was analysed by means of a deposition model ({ORGANIX}), and an individual model for growth and environmental effects was developed for the California sea cucumber Parastichopus californicus. Following validation, the model was combined with existing models for finfish, shellfish, and macroalgae into a framework for simulation of {IMTA} interactions at the local scale. Several scenarios for different culture combinations and densities were simulated using the Farm Aquaculture Resource Management ({FARM}) model, using a layout which reflects typical stocking densities and spatial occupation in Europe and North America. The model allows an analysis of the different sources and fate of particulate organic matter associated with distinct culture groups. Our results illustrate the production enhancement for deposit feeders cultivated below both finfish (600\%) and shellfish (150\%). Furthermore, sea cucumbers are responsible for a significant re- moval of the particulate organic carbon loading to the bottom, reducing the gross load by up to 86\% for finfish culture and 99\% for shellfish culture. The role of cultivated seaweeds in reducing the dissolved nitrogen concen- tration in the farm area was also examined—no significant reduction in ambient nutrient concentration was ob- served, but the added nitrogen provides a clear stimulus (22\% increase) to kelp production. By contrast, shellfish grown in suspended culture in the vicinity of finfish cages show very little change in individual growth or har- vestable biomass. This work helps to analyse the ecological and economic potential of various forms of {IMTA}, and the role of co-cultivation in direct extraction and re-use of materials and energy at both the local (farm) and system (bay, estuary) scales.

	abstract = {Issues such as food safety, quality, health, animal welfare and the environment have become more important for seafood consumers and the general public in recent years, particularly in relation to aquaculture. Moving from monoculture to integrated multi-trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}), may remedy some of the concerns held by the public relating to these issues. Early studies from North America have found that consumers, and indeed the public in general, are supportive of more sustainable aquaculture production systems such as {IMTA}. The study described here adds to our understanding of the general public's perceptions of aquaculture in general and {IMTA} in particular, providing a European perspective. Furthermore, the study identifies factors which should be considered if advancing public recognition of {IMTA}. 2520 web-based survey questionnaires were compiled from across five countries (Ireland, Israel, Italy, Norway and the {UK}), aimed at investigating public understanding of aquaculture benefits and impacts, knowledge of {IMTA}, and also collecting demographic information. The data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression methods. This study determined that both positive and negative perceptions of aquaculture are held by the European general public and that they are influenced by a variety of geographic and demographic traits. The study also identified a lack of awareness of {IMTA} along with positive perceptions of the concept of integrated aquaculture, although the latter results should be treated with some caution. Based on the results, we conclude that there is clear scope to advance public awareness of the role of {IMTA} and this will be necessary to gain mainstream acceptance of this aquaculture practice.},

	abstract = {Maximizing the mitigation potential of open-water finfish-shellfish integrated multi-trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) farms is complex in terms of co-locating the trophic components. Both the dispersal of finfish aquaculture wastes and biological processes are highly influenced by water circulation. Consequently, the evaluation of shellfish-finfish synergy requires a combined study of biological and physical processes, which can be achieved by the implementation and coupling of mathematical models. A highly configurable mathematical model was developed that can be applied at the apparent spatial scale of {IMTA} sites. The model tracks different components of the seston, including feed wastes, fish faeces, shellfish faeces, natural detritus and phytoplankton. Based on the characterization of these fluxes, a hypothetical {IMTA} site was used to explore different spatial arrangements for evaluating finfish-shellfish farm mitigation efficiency. The site was modelled following a factorial design, which tested 2 levels of background seston concentrations, 3 farm designs, 2 hydrodynamic conditions and 2 levels of aquaculture intensity. The model predicts that mitigation efficiency is highly dependent on the background environmental conditions, obtaining maximum mitigation under oligotrophic conditions that stimulate shellfish filtration activity. The dominance of vertical fluxes of particulate matter triggered by the high settling velocity of finfish aquaculture wastes suggests that suspended shellfish aquaculture cannot significantly reduce organic loading of the seabed. Consequently, this suggests that waste mitigation at {IMTA} sites should be best achieved by placing organic extractive species (e.g. deposit feeders) on the seabed directly beneath finfish cages rather than in suspension in the water column.},

The goal of this review was to analyze the status quo of research on aquaculture {ES} and identify knowledge gaps and research priorities to better align {ES} with holistic decision-making. This study conducted a systematic review of the academic literature and analyzed the coverage of aquaculture {ES} across 94 publications. The research field has evolved substantially in the last ten years, reaching a multidisciplinary audience around the world. While research coverage included all major production environments (coastal marine, brackishwater, and freshwater) and cultured species groups (finfish, bivalves, crustaceans, and seaweeds), emphasis is currently limited towards certain types of aquaculture and study areas (namely, brackishwater shrimp farming). This review found a flexible but inconsistent application of {ES} concepts and methods to support multiple decision-contexts including policy, development, and conservation. This paper proposes a research agenda to address research gaps, adopt more holistic {ES}-driven research, and apply consistent and comparable {ES} measures through an aquaculture lens. Ultimately, this should be supported by a shift in thinking that frames aquaculture as ‘aqua-ecosystems’, recognizing aquaculture as fundamentally embedded within linked social and ecological systems.},

	abstract = {Since it was introduced to Zanzibar (Tanzania), seaweed farming has significantly contributed to local, socio-economic development. However, several investigations have shown impacts on the coastal environment near where the farms are located. As many seaweed farms are located on seagrass beds, there is a risk that seaweed farming could affect seagrass beds, and thereby disturb important ecosystem functions and the flow of ecological goods and services. This study compares characteristics of macrophytes (focusing on seagrasses), benthic macrofauna and sediment in seagrass beds, with and without seaweed farms, and a sand bank without vegetation in Chwaka Bay, Zanzibar. The results showed that seagrass beds underneath seaweed farms generally had less seagrass and macroalgae, finer sediment, lower sediment organic matter content and a reduced abundance and biomass of macrofauna, than seagrass beds without seaweed farms. Further, the macrofaunal community structure in seaweed farms showed more similarities to that on the sand bank than in the unfarmed seagrass beds. Most of the dissimilarity was attributable to Lucinidae (suspension-feeding bivalves), which were almost absent in the seaweed farms, resulting in the large difference in biomass between the seaweed farms and the unfarmed seagrass beds. When interpreted together with information from farmers, the observed pattern is believed to be caused by the seaweed farming activities. This indicates that more research is needed to establish the effects of seaweed farming on seagrass beds, and that more attention should be given to the location of farms and the choice of farming methods. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Seaweed farming is often depicted as a sustainable form of aquaculture, but suspected habitat alterations and spread of algae outside farms have rendered speculations on the actual degree of sustainability. We conducted an experimental field study on Unguja Island (Zanzibar, Tanzania) to investigate the effects of off-bottom seaweed farming on a tropical seagrass ecosystem, using 1.5 x 2.5 m experimental farm plots. After 11 wk, above-ground seagrass biomass was 40\% lower than in control plots, owing to a combination of lower shoot density, shoot length and leaf growth rate. Since the biomass was constant between Day 15 and 75 in the farm (F) treatment, but increased by 67 vs. 48\% in the 2 controls (control treatment [C] and stick-and-line control treatment [{CSL}]), the effect exerted by the farm was a lack of potential biomass increase rather than an actual decrease. The effect was transplanted to associated organisms both in terms of lower seagrass epiphyte cover and changes in the abundance of 2 dominating epifauna taxa ({\textgreater}1 cm): sea urchins and sponges. Furthermore, the F treatment caused an accumulation of seagrass leaf litter, but did not affect sediment organic matter ({SOM}) content. The mechanisms behind these effects were not explicitly tested, but algal shading, emergence stress and mechanical abrasion were identified as likely contributors. Interestingly, the effects were largely restricted to 1 of the 2 seagrass species present, Enhalus acoroides, while the other, Thalassia hemprichii, remained more or less unaffected. This may be due to reduced interspecific competition or species-specific differences in morphology and stress tolerance, and could in the long-term have implications for (amongst others) associated fish communities. Although seaweed farming at the current level is less detrimental than, for example, intensive shrimp farming, and therefore should be seen as a strong option for future aquaculture developments, intensive farming on seagrasses should be avoided or at least minimized by, for example, implementing other farming methods. The risk of ecosystem-level changes in large-scale and uncontrolled farm enterprises warrants a holistic and integrated coastal management approach which considers all aspects of the tropical seascape including human societies and natural resource use. © Inter-Research 2006.},

	abstract = {Due to the discharge of nutrients into the East China Sea, severe eutrophication has appeared in Hangzhou Bay. Therefore, we cultivated Gracilaria verrucosa on a large scale in the Jinshan enclosed sea with an area of 1.72 km(2) in the northern part of Hangzhou Bay to perform bioremediation. The Fengxian enclosed sea with an area of 2.3 km(2) and 50 km far from Jinshan was used as the control. The results showed that the Hangzhou Bay was severely eutrophicated before G. verrucosa cultivation. During the period of cultivation between August 2006 and July 2007, the annual growth rate of G. verrucosa was 9.42\% day(-1), and the sea water quality was improved from worse than grade {IV} to grades {II}-{III}, with the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen ({DIN}) and {PO}4-P significantly lower than that in the Fengxian enclosed sea (p {\textless} 0.01). The concentration of {NH}4-N, {NO}3-N, {NO}2-N, and {PO}4-P after G. verrucosa cultivation was decreased by 54.12\%, 75.54\%, 49.81\%, and 49.00\%, respectively. The density of phytoplankton in the Jinshan enclosed sea with cultivation of G. verrucosa was 6.90 -126.53 x 10(4) cells m(-3), which was significantly lower than that in the Fengxian enclosed sea. In addition, species diversity, richness, and evenness was significantly increased after cultivation of G. verrucosa in the Jinshan enclosed sea compared with that in the Fengxian enclosed sea. The density of Skeletonema costatum, Prorocentrum micans, and Prorocentrum donghaiense, which were the usual species of red tides at the coastal sea of China, in the Jinshan enclosed sea with cultivation of G. verrucosa was significantly lower. Based on these results, if the water quality in the Jinshan enclosed sea were to be maintained at grade I ({DIN} a parts per thousand currency sign0.20 mg L-1) or {II} ({DIN} a parts per thousand currency sign0.30 mg L-1), 21.8 t or 18.0 t fresh weight of G. verrucosa need to be cultivated, respectively. These results indicated that large-scale cultivation of G. verrucosa could play a significant role in the bioremediation of Hangzhou Bay.},

Novel measurements were made of the force dynamics of the large intertidal macroalga Durvillaea antarctica under the influence of wave action. Synchronized video, a pressure sensor and a resistance wave gauge provided data describing the wave field. The response of seaweeds to waves was gauged using instrumentation mounted directly on the seaweed, including accelerometers and displacement and force transducers. These field measurements were used to estimate forces and bending moments acting at the holdfast, where failure is most likely to occur. For waves of the order of 0.5 m high, we measured maximum forces on the stipe of around 300 N and blade accelerations that exceeded 30 m s-2. During large wave events, inferred bending moments at the base of the stipe reached average values of around 140 N m. There was a decoupling between the blade response and the force experienced at the stipe base. Furthermore, changes in water depth throughout the tidal cycle had a systematic effect on blade accelerations and moments at the holdfast. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The interaction of surface waves and currents with kelp forests was examined under controlled conditions using a dynamically matched 1/25-scale physical model in a laboratory flume. In experiments with kelp mimics, waves increased the time-averaged drag by a factor of 2 and altered the shape of current profiles. Relative motion between model kelp and water under waves increased wake generation of turbulence, resulting in turbulent kinetic energies 2–5 times larger, and eddy viscosities 20–50\% larger, than for experiments without waves. Because mixing lengths were reduced to wake-scales in the model kelp forest, eddy viscosities were 25–50\% smaller than when kelp was absent. In the model kelp-forest surface canopy where solid obstacles were most densely spaced, wave orbital velocities were reduced by ∼ 10\% from linear wave theory predictions. This decrease in wave orbital velocities is thought to result primarily from inertial forces exerted on water by model kelp. Stokes drift was reduced by ∼ 20\% as a result of the change in wave orbital velocities. Although hydrodynamics within kelp forests are more complex than in the laboratory experiments and a wide range of flow conditions can occur, laboratory results suggest that (1) kelp forest drag is increased by waves; (2) wave properties can be altered by drag and inertial forces; and (3) wake production of turbulence caused by waves may be the main source of turbulence in dense kelp stands. Interactions between kelp and waves must therefore be taken into account when developing models for drag and mixing in these systems.},

	abstract = {The distribution of young sporophytes (up to 0.25 m stipe length) of the kelp Ecklonia maxima, on various substrate, at depths of 2.5 to 5.0 m, was studied at 8 sites on the southwest coast of South Africa. The most common substratum available was rock (bare or covered with encrusting coralline algae), followed by kelp holdfasts, and the ascidian Pyura stolonifera at some sites. A disproportionately high ratio (relative to the available substrate) of young sporophytes grew on the holdfasts of mature kelps at most sites, but particularly where high densities of benthic invertebrate grazers were present (mainly the urchin Parechinus angulosus, also abelone Haliotis midae, limpets Patella spp. and gastropods Turbo spp. and Oxystele spp.). Jacobs' index of electivity was used an indicator of 'preference for' (interpreted as indicating survival on) the substratum type. This showed a statistically significant 'negative selection' of rock as a substratum at sites where grazers were numerous. The ratios of young sporophytes on holdfasts/young sporophytes on rock were directly proportional to grazer densities when sites were compared (r = -0.90, p = 0.002), supporting the hypothesis that mature holdfasts are an important refuge for recruitment of E. maxima sporophytes. There was an inverse relationship between percentage cover of understorey algae and grazer densities (r = 0.92, p = 0.001). In general, sites east of Cape Point (west coast/south coast transition zone) have far more grazers and reduced understorey algal biomasses compared to west coast sites. There thus appear to be fundamental differences in some of the major ecological processes in kelp beds in these 2 areas, with important implications for commercial kelp harvesting.},

	abstract = {Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) possesses ecological and socio-economic advantages, relative to single-species aquaculture. The promotion of a sustainable aquaculture industry requires that decision-makers, ecosystem managers and farmers have sufficient quantitative information associated with its implementation from both public and private perspectives. The present paper applies the Differential Drivers-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (Δ{DPSIR}) methodological approach to an ecological and economic comparison between mono-aquaculture and {IMTA}. Data from a South African 240-{tonyearΔ}1 abalone farm were used as a case study. Three operation schemes were considered: abalone monoculture in a flow-through system; and two {IMTA} schemes, which recycle water and replace 10\% and 30\% of kelp consumption with on-farm-grown seaweed. The analysis indicates a decrease in the aquaculture generated ecological pressures with the incorporation of seaweeds, mainly a reduction in nitrogen discharges into the adjacent coastal ecosystem (by 3.7 to 5.0tonsyear-1), a reduction in harvest of natural kelp beds (by 2.2 to 6.6hayear-1) and a reduction of {GHG} emissions (by 290 to 350tons {CO}2eyear-1). Adopting an {IMTA} configuration raised farm profits by 1.4 to 5\%. The corresponding overall gain from using {IMTA} in the case study is several folds larger than the net gain in profit, and is estimated between 1.1 and 3.0million U.S. dollar per annum. This range of values reflects the gains of adopting {IMTA} on (i) economic value of the aquaculture, i.e. farm's profit, (ii) value of environmental externalities, and (iii) implementation costs. The analysis suggests that the value of the benefits to the public by adopting the {IMTA} configurations can be larger than the gains in farm's profitability. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Here, we used qualitative network models ({QNMs}) to examine the potential community effects of increasing bivalve aquaculture in South Puget Sound, a large estuarine system in Washington, United States. {QNMs} are formalized conceptual models that require only a qualitative understanding of how variables composing a system interact (that is, the sign of interactions: +, –, and 0) and are therefore well-suited to data-limited systems. Specifically, we examined community-wide responses to scenarios in which bivalve cultivation effort increased for three different bivalve species (Manila clam Venerupis philippinarum, Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and geoduck Panopea generosa). Further, we evaluated community-wide responses to the removal of benthic bivalve predators, a future increase in nutrient loadings, and combinations of these scenarios acting simultaneously. The scenarios enabled identification of potential trade-offs between increased aquaculture and shifts in the abundance of community members and assessment of the possible effects of different management actions. We also analysed the {QNM} to identify key interactions that influence the sign outcome of community responses to press perturbations, highlighting potential points for management intervention and linkages deserving of more focused quantitative study. {QNMs} are mathematically robust and highly flexible, but remain underutilized. We suggest that they may serve as valuable tools for supporting ecosystem approaches to aquaculture.},

	abstract = {The expansion of the aquaculture industry in the last several decades has raised concerns about potential ecological impacts of the industry. Bivalve culture, particularly mussel farming, relies on naturally occurring plankton and numerous studies have demonstrated top-down control on phytoplankton, increased nutrients through excretion of metabolic wastes and remineralization of faeces and pseudofaeces, and bottom-up effects on predators and scavengers through mussel fall-off. However, results are inconsistent between studies, and hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient availability are thought to play an important role in the magnitude and the direction of the ecological effects of mussel culture on the surrounding ecosystem. We used qualitative network models ({QNMs}), to outline a general model that integrates these environmental conditions and (1) evaluated the ability of different model configurations to reproduce known responses to perturbations, (2) analyzed the behaviour of key components to contrasting hydrodynamic and nutrient condition scenarios, and (3) identified the most influential features of the derived scenarios. The model that included uncertain linkages to characterize unknown relationships performed best based on predetermined validation criteria; the addition of semi-quantitative information on the relative strength of certain linkages improved accuracy and sign determinacy of outcomes. The presence of suspended mussel culture negatively affected primary producers, zooplankton and deposit-feeders, and had a positive effect on predators and scavengers, especially in low-energy environments. Hydrodynamic conditions were shown to have a major impact on the response of the community to mussel culture, while nutrient availability had a very minor impact.},

This framework is used in conjunction with two hypothetical models of the offsetting process to illustrate a number of issues that can arise when conducting impact evaluations of biodiversity offsetting, where the ‘intervention’ comprises a development and its associated offsets. We establish that including gains due to avoided losses (i.e. development that would have otherwise happened) in the intervention impact calculation results in a reduction in the offset requirements per unit of development. This occurs regardless of whether the biodiversity at the development or offset sites is declining, stable, or improving. We also show how including gains due to avoided loss requires the consideration of offsets that might otherwise have occurred. These ‘avoided offsets’ increase the offset requirements per unit of development regardless of the background site dynamics. Finally, we examine offsetting as part of a larger, spatially strategic scheme and show that when the development and offset regions are separated, including avoided loss in the impact calculations can result in a situation where the development impact goes to zero and a system that attains ‘net gain’ regardless of the development and offsetting activities. The proposed framework can be used to inform offset policy by providing a transparent and logical methodology for the determining the offset requirements for the impacts attributed to development.},

	abstract = {The roles of "top-down" and "bottom-up" factors were investigated in terms of their influence on the diatom and dinoflagellate abundances in the microtidal, salt wedge Huon Estuary, Tasmania, Australia. Long-term (1996-2005) changes in Chl a, the peridinin:Chl a ratio and the abundance of autotrophic dinoflagellates were observed to coincide with the warming of regional surface waters. There were significant seasonal differences in pigment-specific net growth rates for Chl a, peridinin and fucoxanthin. Diatoms dominated the spring bloom when species such as Skeletonema costatum had the highest net growth rates and fucoxanthin-specific gross growth rates were ∼0.9 day-1. During late summer, the peridinin-specific grazing mortality was significantly less than the fucoxanthin-specific grazing mortality and dinoflagellates increased their dominance of the phytoplankton community. This late summer relaxation of grazing pressure on dinoflagellates was associated with a decline in the overall abundance of microheterotroph ({MH}) grazers and a peak in the abundance, biomass and estimated grazing rates of mesozooplankton. We suggest the composition of the autumn phytoplankton community was dependent upon a trophic cascade where mesozooplankton, such as Noctiluca scintillans, preyed upon {MHs} and reduced their grazing upon some species of dinoflagellates. © The Author 2008.

There were no consistent effects of drying method on the nutritional composition and concentration of contaminants amongst sites and species. Overall, significant variation in protein content was reported amongst sites, lipids were generally low ({\textless}2\%), while ash and nitrogen-free extract ({NFE}) were high. Contaminants were low in concentration in all samples, with mercury (Hg) below the detection limit. Results reported here suggest that M. pyrifera and L. corrugata have an overall nutritional composition conducive to human and animal consumption, except for the iodine content which was above the maximum tolerable level in dried seaweed established by Food Standards Australia New Zealand, and support species selection and sites for the development of seaweed aquaculture systems in south-eastern Australia. However, we found that the more expensive freeze-drying of samples did not consistently yield higher nutritional quality than air-dried samples. These findings will inform commercial applications of seaweeds in multiple sectors (e.g. food, feed/agriculture, and nutraceutical) for the development of the Australian seaweed industry, projected to reach a value of \$1.5 billion by 2040.},

	abstract = {The kelp Lessonia corrugata (Ochrophyta, Laminariales) is being developed for integrated multi-trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) trials in the vicinity of salmon cages in Tasmania, Australia. Gametophytes are vegetally maintained before seeding on hatchery twine; however, the optimal temperature and light conditions for growth and sexual development are unknown. We measured vegetative size of female and male gametophytes and sexual development of females over a range of temperatures and irradiances using a temperature gradient table and neutral density light filters. Over a 4-week experiment, gametophytes were exposed to a combination of thermal (5.7–24.9 °C) and irradiance (10–100 μmol photons m−2 s−1) gradients, to assess biological performance. At the temperature extremes (hottest = 24.9 °C, coldest = 5.7 °C), we observed the critical thermal limits for this species and the results reveal a narrow optimal temperature range for growth and sexual development between 15.7 and 17.9 °C, with irradiances between 40 and 100 μmol photons m−2 s−1 resulting in fertile female gametophytes. Lessonia corrugata inhabits a small geographic range, found only around Tasmania, south of the Australian mainland, hence oceanic changes such as ongoing increases in sea surface temperatures ({SSTs}), and altered irradiance regimes may limit recruitment of the early microscopic life stages in the future. Our findings provide optimised culture conditions for aquaculture and information to predict the future geographic range of L. corrugata under ocean global change.},

We used Landsat satellite imagery to develop the first long-term (1986− 2015) data set describing the cover of dense surface canopies of giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera around the entire coastline of Tasmania, Australia, and assessed the extent to which potential environmental drivers explain the dynamics of surface canopies at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Broad-scale temporal patterns in canopy cover are correlated with El Niño−Southern Oscillation events, while regional patterns are related to sea surface temperature and nutrient regimes are associated with the East Australian Current. Regression models developed to predict the presence or absence of giant kelp canopy emphasise the importance of sea surface temperature in these systems. Long-term decline in canopy cover is clearly evident in most regions, and in light of increasing thermal stress associated with a changing ocean climate, this raises concern for the future of this species as a major habitat-forming kelp in Australia and some other regions worldwide. Given that Tasmania represents the stronghold of the range of this species in Australia, but is a geographic trap in that there is no suitable habitat for M. pyrifera to the south, our findings support the Federal listing of giant kelp communities in Australia as an endangered marine community type.},

The main objective was to analyse the degree of relevance these findings have for large-scale implementation of integrated mariculture practices, and to identify necessary research areas for a future research agenda. The following directions for future research were identified: (1) understand in detail the important biological/biochemical processes in closed recirculating and open seaweed culture systems; (2) conduct research into these advanced aquaculture technologies at scales relevant to commercial implementation or suitable for extrapolation; (3) broaden the focus to include factors affecting seaweed growth and uptake capacity; (4) improve experimental design for statistical calculations; (5) attain a detailed understanding of the temporal variability in seaweed-filtered mariculture systems; (6) define numerical design parameters critical for engineers in designing commercial recirculation systems with seaweed filters; (7) study the influences of location-specific parameters, such as latitude, climate and local seaweed strains/species, on seaweed filter performance; (8) include economic components, considering the added value of seaweeds, and feasibility aspects; (9) analyse the role and function of integrated aquaculture practices for improved environmental, economic, and social acceptability within the broader perspective of integrated coastal management initiatives; and (10) develop educational, training and financial incentive approaches to transfer these novel and somewhat complex technologies of integrated mariculture from the scientists to the industry. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Pieces of kelp blades that were completely covered on one side by the bryozoans Lichenopora novae-zelandiae Busk or Membranipora membranacea, L., or uncolonized (clean treatment), were used to estimate the rate at which nitrate and ammonium were removed from the surrounding seawater. In addition, the rate of ammonium excretion by bryozoans isolated from their associated kelp was measured and also estimated from the results of the uptake experiments. Values obtained were used to estimate the contribution of ammonium excreted by bryozoans to the total amount of inorganic nitrogen available to the associated kelp. Both bryozoan species reduced the ability of the associated kelp to remove nitrate and ammonium from seawater but provided a source of ammonium to the kelp through excretion. The nitrogen status of colonized and clean kelp disks was determined from the ratio of total particulate carbon to total particulate nitrogen (C:N ratio). The C:N ratios for A. fimbriatum colonized with either L. novae-zelandiae or M. membranacea were similar (C:N=12 to 14), and differences between colonized and clean treatments were not significant. For A. fimbriatum, therefore, the C:N ratio indicates that this species was not nitrogen limited at the time of the present study. In contrast, both colonized and clean disks of M. integrifolia were nitrogen limited, but colonized disks (C:N=19) were significantly less limited by nitrogen than clean disks (C:N=29). Results are discussed in relation to the different environments inhabited by both kelp species and are consistent with the hypothesis that ammonium excreted by bryozoans was an important source of inorganic nitrogen to M. integrifolia, but not to A. fimbriatum, at the time of the study. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Although nutrient availability and oceanographic context can influence top-down processes in intertidal communities, the reciprocal effects of consumers on bottom-up processes, such as nitrogen uptake by macroalgae, are less well-documented. We used a combination of field observations, mesocosm experiments, and laboratory nitrate-uptake measurements to evaluate the interaction between the kelp crab Pugettia producta and its preferred food source, the kelp Egregia menziesii, in northern California, {USA}. We found that P. producta fed selectively on E. menziesii, removing tissues with a high surface area to volume ratio ({SA}:V), which resulted in a 66 \% decrease in overall {SA}:V. Because these high {SA}:V tissues are disproportionately more responsible for nitrate uptake, selective herbivory by P. producta decreased E. menziesii's biomass-specific uptake of nitrogen, the primary limiting nutrient in this ecosystem, by 65 \% per gram of remaining algal tissue. In field surveys, where P. producta abundances were high, E. menziesii thalli more frequently exhibited signs of intense grazing and thus had lower {SA}:V ratios, suggesting that grazing is sufficiently intense in the field to generate differences in algal morphology and nitrate uptake. P. producta therefore influences E. menziesii biomass and productivity from the top down, by removing substantial amounts of biomass, and from the bottom up, by reducing the kelp's subsequent ability to acquire nutrients. Because of selective grazing on specialized tissues, the effects of mesoherbivores, like P. producta, on the structure and dynamics of marine communities may often be greater than predicted simply by the biomass they consume. © Inter-Research 2007.},

To reduce this environmental impact, commercial extractive species can be grown alongside to utilize and reduce this waste, a technique known as integrated multitrophic aquaculture ({IMTA}). Information is lacking on whether (i) {IMTA} is generally successful with respect to extractive species growth responses and (ii) at what spatial scale they can be cultivated from fish cage nutrient sources. Focussing on bivalves and macroalgae as extractive species, this study uses a meta-analysis approach to summarize and conclude peer-reviewed data on {IMTA} to address these information gaps. We show that there are clear benefits to integrating bivalves and macroalgae with fish farms. Bivalves grown within, and relatively near, fish cages (0 m and 1–60 m distance categories, respectively) showed significantly higher biomass production relative to controls compared to those grown at larger spatial scales (61+ m). However, biomass production of macroalgae was significantly higher than controls only within close proximity to fish cages (0 m). This information shows increased extractive species production is generally greatest at relatively small spatial scales. It also highlights the need for more site-specific information (e.g. seawater parameters, hydrodynamics, food supply, farm capacity) in future studies. The allocation of control sites and locating these at suitable distances ({\textgreater}1–8 km) from fish farm effluent sources to avoid fish farm nutrient contamination are also recommended.},

	abstract = {Rising global demand for seafood and declining catches have resulted in the volume of mariculture doubling each decade, a growth expected by the {FAO} to persist in the decades to come. This growth should use technologies with economical and environmental sustainability. Feed accounts for about half the cost in current high-volume fed mono-species aquaculture, mainly fish net pens or shrimp/fish ponds, yet most of this feed becomes waste. The resulting environmental impact and rising feed costs therefore hamper further growth of such farms. As in certain traditional polyculture schemes, plants can drastically reduce feed use and environmental impact of industrialized mariculture and at the same time add to its income. These nutrient-assimilating photoautotrophic plants use solar energy to turn nutrient-rich effluents into profitable resources. Plants counteract the environmental effects of the heterotrophic fed fish and shrimp and restore water quality. Today's integrated intensive aquaculture approaches, developed from traditional extensive polyculture, integrate the culture of fish or shrimp with vegetables, microalgae, shellfish and/or seaweeds. Integrated mariculture can take place in coastal waters or in ponds and can be highly intensified. Today's technologies are well studied and documented. They are generic, modular and adaptable for several culture combinations of fish, shrimp, shellfish, abalone, sea urchin and several species of commercially important seaweeds and vegetables. A 1-ha land-based integrated seabream-shellfish-seaweed farm can produce 25 tons of fish, 50 tons of bivalves and 30 tons fresh weight of seaweeds annually. Another farm model can produce in 1 ha 55 tons of seabream or 92 tons of salmon, with 385 or 500 fresh weight of seaweed, respectively, without pollution. Preliminary calculations show a potential for high profitability with large integrated farms. Several freshwater integrated fish-vegetable farms and a couple of modern fish-algae-shellfish/abalone integrated mariculture farms exist today, and several additional farms are planned. Three major international R\&D projects promise to soon expand the horizons of the technology further. Therefore, modern integrated systems in general, and seaweed-based systems in particular, are bound to play a major role in the sustainable expansion of world aquaculture. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Rapid scale growth of intensive mariculture systems can often lead to adverse impacts on the environment. Intensive fish and shrimp farming, being defined as throughput-based systems, have a continuous or pulse release of nutrients that adds to coastal eutrophication. As an alternative treatment solution, seaweeds can be used to clean the dissolved part of this effluent. Two examples of successfully using seaweeds as biofilters in intensive mariculture systems are discussed in this paper. The first example shows that Gracilaria co-cultivated with salmon in a tank system reached production rates as high as 48.9 kg m-2 a-1, and could remove 50\% of the dissolved ammonium released by the fish in winter, increasing to 90-95\% in spring. In the second example, Gracilaria cultivated on ropes near a 22-t fish cage farm, had up to 40\% higher growth rate (specific growth rate of 7\% d-1) compared to controls. Extrapolation of the results showed that a 1 ha Gracilaria culture gave an annual harvest of 34 t (d. wt), and assimilated 6.5\% of the released dissolved nitrogen. This production and assimilation was more than twice that of a Gracilaria monoculture. By integrating seaweeds with fish farming the nutrient assimilating capacity of an area increases. With increased carrying capacity it will be possible to increase salmon cage densities before risking negative environmental effects like eutrophication and toxic algal blooms sometimes associated with the release of dissolved nutrients. The potential for using mangroves and/or seaweeds as filters for wastes from intensive shrimp pond farming is also discussed. It is concluded that such techniques, based on ecological engineering, seems promising for mitigating environmental impacts from intensive mariculture; however, continued research on this type of solution is required.},

We review aspects of {IMTA}’s economic potential and market acceptance and consider ways to address the current gaps in our understanding. We find that adopting {IMTA} raises the assimilative capacity of the farm and that {IMTA} substantively reduces the environmental cost of aquaculture. Moreover, integrating extractive species (e.g. invertebrates and/or seaweeds), with existing fed-monoculture operations, can increase farm profits. The presence of positive public attitudes towards {IMTA}, as expressed by a willingness to pay a premium for its products, can further increase the profitability of adopting {IMTA}. Areas requiring more economic research include the development of comparative bioeconomic models of {IMTA} and the evaluation of competing production systems and their ability to internalize externalities to demonstrate the true value of {IMTA} to society. Further exploration of economic incentives, such as instruments needed to foster adoption of {IMTA}, and investigation of marketing opportunities, such as promoting the eco-certification of {IMTA} products, are also needed. Our paper aimed to inform economists and non-economists alike about the latest developments in {IMTA} economics, and spur further research on critical topics concerning this important subject.},

C. Agardh. The sheet-like colonies of the bryozoan Membranipora membranacea (L.) markedly reduced the pigment concentration of colonized blade tissue, but only during winter. Reductions in pigment concentration are most likely a result of damage to underlying tissue due to some factor related to the presence of bryozoan colonies on blade surfaces. Blade tissue colonized by M. membranacea also had higher δ15N signatures than surrounding bryozoan-free tissue, possibly indicating the provision of nitrogen to M. pyrifera by bryozoan colonies. Results show that seasonal changes in nitrogen and colony size can strongly modify the effect of epifauna on macroalgae they colonize. Unlike bryozoans, hydroid colonies provided no barrier to nitrogen uptake by colonized M. pyrifera tissue and enhanced ammonium uptake was observed for tissue colonized by O. geniculata during nitrogen limitation. Epifauna with stoloniferous growth forms such as hydroids are more likely to have benign or even mutualistic relationships with macroalgae they colonize than the sheet-like colonies of bryozoans.},

	abstract = {The performance and survival of macroalgae is largely determined by their ability to adjust to varying environmental conditions. In this study, we investigated the short-term response of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera to varying temperatures (6, 17 and 24 °C) and low and high nitrate conditions (5 μM and 80 μM nitrate) on lipid and fatty acid levels. Results revealed that M. pyrifera was able to rapidly adjust to varying temperatures by changing the saturation level of the fatty acid composition at low and high nitrate conditions. On a lipid level, we observed interactive effects of temperature and nutrient conditions. Under high nitrate conditions, M. pyrifera maintained the same lipid profile. However, under low nitrate and high temperature conditions, an increase in free fatty acids ({FFA}) was observed, indicative of lipid degeneration at high temperatures. Results show that low nitrogen concentrations can magnify the negative effects of short term temperature stress in the giant kelp M. pyrifera. Our findings indicate that under rapid warming events, local nitrate availability might be a decisive factor for the acclimation potential of M. pyrifera.},

	abstract = {The consequences of declining biodiversity remain controversial, in part because many studies focus on a single metric of ecosystem functioning and fail to consider diversity’s integrated effects on multiple ecosystem functions. We used tide pool microcosms as a model system to show that different conclusions about the potential effects of producer diversity on ecosystem functioning may result when ecosystem functions are measured separately vs. together. Specifically, we found that in diverse seaweed assemblages, uptake of either nitrate or ammonium alone was equal to the average of the component monocultures. However, when nitrate and ammonium were available simultaneously, uptake by diverse assemblages was 22\% greater than the monoculture average because different species were complementary in their use of different nitrogen forms. Our results suggest that when individual species have dominant effects on particular ecosystem processes (i.e., the sampling effect), multivariate complementarity can arise if different species dominate different processes. Further, these results suggest that similar mechanisms (complementary nutrient uptake) may underlie diversity–functioning relationships in both algal and vascular-plant- based systems.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of intensive fed aquaculture (e.g. finfish and shrimp) throughout the world is associated with concerns about the environmental impacts of such often monospecific practices, especially where activities are highly geographically concentrated or located in suboptimal sites whose assimilative capacity is poorly understood and, consequently, prone to being exceeded. One of the main environmental issues is the direct discharge of significant nutrient loads into coastal waters from open-water systems and with the effluents from land-based systems. In its search for best management practices, the aquaculture industry should develop innovative and responsible practices that optimize its efficiency and create diversification, while ensuring the remediation of the consequences of its activities to maintain the health of coastal waters. To avoid pronounced shifts in coastal processes, conversion, not dilution, is a common-sense solution, used for centuries in Asian countries. By integrating fed aquaculture (finfish, shrimp) with inorganic and organic extractive aquaculture (seaweed and shellfish), the wastes of one resource user become a resource (fertilizer or food) for the others. Such a balanced ecosystem approach provides nutrient bioremediation capability, mutual benefits to the cocultured organisms, economic diversification by producing other value-added marine crops, and increased profitability per cultivation unit for the aquaculture industry. Moreover, as guidelines and regulations on aquaculture effluents are forthcoming in several countries, using appropriately selected seaweeds as renewable biological nutrient scrubbers represents a cost-effective means for reaching compliance by reducing the internalization of the total environmental costs. By adopting integrated polytrophic practices, the aquaculture industry should find increasing environmental, economic, and social acceptability and become a full and sustainable partner within the development of integrated coastal management frameworks.},

Absorption rates were measured taking into account a previous surface characterization, which gave values of 44 ± 14 cm2/g and 18 ± 6 cm2/g for aquatic seedlings and wild algae, respectively. The following parameters were measured during the experimental runs: temperature, {pH}, O2, illuminance or light intensity, salinity and total solids. {TAN} removals of 61\% and 70\% were achieved for the seedlings and Macrocystis spp., respectively, after 17 h of treatment. The {TAN} absorption results were expressed as a function of surface and mass achieving the following values: 3.0 nmol N cm-2 h-1 and 111 nmol N g-1 h-1 for the seedlings, and 6.9 nmol N cm-2 h-1 and 122.4 nmol N g-1 h-1 for the macroalgae. In the light of these biofiltration processes, the initial {TAN} concentration decreased by 90\% for the seedlings and wild algae over approximately 110 and 41 h, respectively.

One of the most encouraging experiences involves the development of seaweed farming for human consumption in combination with mussel rafts in Galicia ({NW} Spain). Here, we describe a new and more productive marine farming system of Saccharina latissima (“sugar kelp”) combined with mussel rafts. We show its level of integration in terms of harvest and protein content as well as an assessment of the sources of assimilated nitrogen through the analysis of δ15N isotope ratios. Oceanographic conditions in Northwest Spain make S. latissima behave like a winter-spring species in culture with a growing period of just 5–6 months. Nonetheless, production values in our experiment equalled or exceeded those recorded in northern parts of the Atlantic where the culturing period is almost twice as long. Compared to natural populations, S. latissima from mussel-integrated culture systems had almost twice as much protein content, giving greater added value to the species both as food and feed.},

We discuss several physiological and ecological factors affecting Macrocystis populations, particularly as they may influence competition with other seaweed species. Successful competition for light appears to explain much of the success by Macrocystis in dominating its environment. Although nutrient limitation may sometimes curtail Macrocystis productivity, a role in competitive success has not been documented. Water temperature controls the large scale geographic distribution of Macrocystis, but usually is rather minor on a local scale. Water motion apparently does not have important affects on competition except for influences from wave exposure. Salinity changes may control Macrocystis distributions where large freshwater inputs occur into semi-enclosed embayments. Sedimentation may affect microscopic stages in the kelp life history, with differential effects on various competitive species. Encrustations and preferential grazing may affect competitiveness. Unstudied but probably influential factors include disease, plant aging and some aspects of nutrition. Interactions between all these factors are complex, but are under investigation by modelling techniques with some interesting findings that help explain and comprehend the ecology of this useful plant. © 1986.},

	abstract = {Marine macroalgae grow and produce biomass at a rapid rate. Large-scale oceanic farms planted with these plants could provide a renewable source of energy and copious amounts of organic feedstocks for the chemical industry, without interfering with food and fiber production on land. Past projections of the potential of large-scale macroalgal mariculture have been based on estimates of yield rather than actual cultivation trials. In the last year, we planted one acre with 722 plants arranged in three different planting densities. This was done in order to test our cultivation methods and determine what the yield is from plants grown on a farm. We have studied the effects of transplanting, handling, cultivation, density, fertilization and harvesting on a population of farmed giant kelp plants. Furthermore, we have been able to gain an appreciation of plant-to-plant variability in growth rate. The results of our work to date indicate that kelp plants grown in the sea are amenable to cultivation. They respond to fertilizer applications and show the effects of competition for light when grown at high planting densities. Under optimum growing conditions, some plants are able to produce nearly a kilo of wet biomass per day. In our view, the very encouraging results of this kelp farming effort show that the giant kelp is nearly as productive as some of the most highly productive land plant crops like sugar cane. It should be possible to further increase the yield from this prototype marine farm through improved marine agronomic practices.},

	abstract = {Kelp forests dominate the rocky coasts of temperate Australia and are the foundation of the Great Southern Reef. Much like terrestrial forests, these marine forests create complex habitat for diverse communities of flora and fauna. Kelp forests also support coastal food-webs and valuable fisheries and provide a suite of additional ecosystem services. In many regions of Australia and around the world, kelp forests are in decline due to ocean warming, overgrazing, and pollution. One potential tool in the conservation and management of these important ecosystems is habitat restoration, the science and practice of which is currently undergoing substantial expansion. We summarize the present state of Australian kelp forests and emphasize that consideration of the initial drivers of kelp decline is a critical first step in restoration. With a focus on Australian examples, we review methods, implementation and outcomes of kelp forest restoration, and discuss suitable measures of success and the estimated costs of restoration activities. We propose a workflow and decision system for kelp forest restoration that identifies alternative pathways for implementation and acknowledges that under some circumstances restoration at scale is not possible or feasible. As a case study, we then apply the Society for Ecological Restoration’s 5-star evaluation to Operation Crayweed, Australia’s primary example of kelp forest restoration. Overall, no single method of kelp forest restoration is suitable for all situations, but outcomes can be optimized by ameliorating the driver(s) of kelp decline and achieving ongoing natural recruitment of kelp. Whilst scalability of kelp forest restoration to the seascape-scale remains a considerable challenge, the present review should provide a platform for future restoration efforts. However, it is also crucial to emphasize that the challenges of restoration place a high value on preventative conservation and protection of existing kelp forest ecosystems – prevention is invariably better than cure.},

	abstract = {Abstract Foundation species support immense biodiversity and underpin stability and resilience of entire ecosystems. Understanding the physical and environmental conditions that mediate variation in the presence and abundance of foundation species is key to managing and understanding these ecosystems in the face of anthropogenic change. We examine potential drivers of the presence and percent cover of the kelp, Ecklonia radiata along ten degrees of latitude off mainland Eastern Australia. We used a model selection process to determine what environmental drivers explained the most variability in the spatial distribution and cover of Ecklonia. Interestingly, the distribution and cover of Ecklonia was not related to sea surface temperature or latitude. Instead, depth and the presence of urchins best explained the presence of Ecklonia with the addition of nutrients (in neighbouring catchments) and substrate in explaining percent cover of Ecklonia. The highest covers of Ecklonia occurred on reefs close to catchments with high and very high nutrient and sediment loads. The heterogenous distribution and the high covers of Ecklonia at warmer, low latitudes demonstrate the thermal tolerance of this kelp. Kelp forest presence and abundance can be complex and driven by spatially heterogeneous drivers rather than gradients in environmental conditions such as temperature. Understanding the interplay of drivers in structuring kelp forest distribution and cover is critical for predicting how changing climates and anthropogenic stress impacts foundation species and the ecosystems they support.},

In this study, we examined how changes in ocean temperature and associated nitrate concentrations driven by the strengthening of the East Australian Current ({EAC}) will influence the morphology, reproduction and development of the widespread kelp Ecklonia radiata in southeastern Australia. E. radiata morphology and reproduction were examined at sites in New South Wales ({NSW}) and Tasmania, where sea surface temperature differs by {\textasciitilde}5°C, and a laboratory experiment was conducted to test the interactive effects of temperature and nutrients on E. radiata development. E. radiata size and amount of reproductive tissue were generally greater in the cooler waters of Tasmania compared to {NSW}. Importantly, one morphological trait (lamina length) was a strong predictor of the amount of reproductive tissue, suggesting that morphological changes in response to increased temperature may influence reproductive capacity in E. radiata. Growth of gametophytes was optimum between 15 and 22°C and decreased by {\textgreater}50\% above 22°C. Microscopic sporophytes were also largest between 15 and 22°C, but no sporophytes developed above 22°C, highlighting a potentially critical upper temperature threshold for E. radiata in Tasmania. Lower nitrate concentration had no effect on E. radiata gametophytes and sporophytes. Given forecast increases in ocean temperature of between 2 and 3°C in southeastern Australia by 2100, these findings suggest that E. radiata is likely to be affected by a strengthening {EAC} and highlight the susceptibility of the development and growth of early life-cycle stages to these changes. © Inter-Research 2013.},

Through experimental manipulation we have evaluated the effects of the abiotic environment, smallsize grazers and mid-littoral algae on the survival of the juveniles of L. nigrescens recruited in the upper part of its vertical range. Disturbance effects of adult plants and grazing effects of large-sized subtidal herbivores on juvenile recruitment, and effects of interspecific interference on the survival of newly settled juveniles were also evaluated Interference by adult plants and grazing by large-sized subtidal herbivores completely inhibit recruitment. In their absence, the abiotic environment limits recruitment and growth of L. nigrescens at the uppermost tidal level while inter-specific interference owing to over-shading by the fastest growing individuals hmits the lower-most extent of the belt. Interference by adult plants and grazing are patchy and often mutually exclusive in the field. Recruitment within the band of L. nigrescens is maximal in patchy vegetational openings which are large enough to experience reduced disturbance by adult plants and small enough for reduced grazing pressure. In mature, consolidated belts of L. nigrescens on vertical walls these openings correspond to roughly triangular areas with the hypothenuse formed by interholdfast distances of 1 to 2 m. Such patchy vegetational openings can be produced normally by dislodgement of old, eroded plants.},

Microscopic gametophytes alternate with macroscopic sporophytes, characteristic of members of the order Laminariales.

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to understand the growth dynamics of Saccharina japonica (previously known as Laminaria japonica), particularly the portion lost during its growth cycle and the key factors that control loss rate in Sungo Bay, China. Growth and loss of S. japonica were investigated between January and July 2010 in Sungo Bay. Losses of the seaweed are typically the result of three factors: removal of the entire individual from mariculture ropes (falloff), breakage in sections of the thalli (breakoff), and erosion of distal tissue. Results showed that individual growth rates in wet weight ranged between 2. 4 and 32. 7 g day -1. The total falloff rate was approximately 16\% and took place during January and February. Breakoff rate showed a significant positive correlation with kelp length and took place during June and July. The erosion rate increased significantly from January to the end of April, reaching a maximum value of 20. 4 g day -1 on 25 April, and maintained a relatively higher value following the peak value (approximately 10-15 g day -1). Erosion rates were positively correlated with temperature (r = 0. 787, n = 23, p \& 0. 01) before May; however, they were not significantly correlated with temperature from May to July (p = {\textgreater}0. 05). There was no significant relationship between erosion and transparency. At the end of this experiment, the ratio of total loss of carbon and nitrogen to gross production was 61\% and 54\%, respectively. Loss from distal erosion, falloff, and breakoff in carbon was 91. 5, 4. 2, and 4. 3\%, respectively. In Sungo Bay, the annual gross production and total loss in carbon and nitrogen were estimated to be 58,652 t C and 3,506 t N, and 36,150 t C and 1,920 t N. This is expected to have a significant impact on the detritus available in the food chain. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {Apart from certain studies on Macrocystis pyrifera (Linnaeus) C. Agardh, very few in situ experimental studies on production have been carried out to verify that ``bottom-up effects\{''\} (relating to nutrient supply) are more important than ``top-down\{''\} effects (relating to herbivory) in temperate kelp forests. The effects of nutrient supply on recruitment and production of hatchery-raised gametophytes of Saccharina japonica, cultivated on a rope, and wild Saccharina religiosa, cultivated on a rope and on new concrete reefs placed at the sea bottom, were examined at an experimental site with artificial nutrient addition continuously from October 2008 to May 2009 and compared to kelp that was cultivated from October 2008 to May 2009 without nutrient supply, at a natural site in Tomari (Sea of Japan, southwestern Hokkaido, Japan). At both sites, sea urchins were removed for exclusion of top-down effect. At the natural site, no hatchery-raised S. japonica and wild S. religiosa grew on the rope. No wild S. religiosa grew on the porous-concrete reefs and rocks. At the nutrient-enhanced site, S. japonica and S. religiosa grew rapidly on the rope, at rates of 47.7 and 33.3 plants/10 cm length rope, respectively. S. religiosa grew on the concrete reefs at a concentration of 9.7 plants/0.3 m(2). At the nutrient-enhanced site, the concentrations of {NH}4-N, {NO}3-N, {NO}2-N, and {PO}4-P ranged from 35.2-173.2, 2.1-10.9, 0.3-1.5, and 0.8-2.6 mu mol L-1, respectively, being markedly higher than those at the natural site, where these nutrient concentrations were almost equal to the averages off Tomari. These results indicate that the production of Saccharina kelp is restricted by bottom-up effects (at a low nutrient concentration) in the Sea of Japan, southwestern Hokkaido. Nutrient supply would be essential for growth enhancement of Saccharina kelp production in a marine environment around Japan where, in recent times, water temperatures have increased by ca. 0.5 A degrees C and nutrient concentrations have decreased.},

	abstract = {Nutrient-rich, brackish seawater arises in the southwestern fjords of Norway where much freshwater runoff from the mountains is combined with nutrients from agriculture and smolt farms located along the fjords. This work evaluates the potential of short-term remediation of the nutrients from the fjord water by means of macroalgae. In the first experiment, seawater with a salinity of 25–34‰ without nutrients was compared with brackish water with a salinity of 18‰ with added nitrate and phosphate. After 13-day exposure to the elevated nutrient level, the protein and N content of young sporophytes of Saccharina latissima and Laminaria digitata increased by 25–47 and 31–33\%, respectively. In a second 5-day experiment, elevated nutrients increased the N content by 40\% in young sporophytes of S. latissima while it was unaffected in older sporophytes. The N content in L. digitata increased 34\% in young sporophytes and 20\% in older sporophytes. Nitrate contributed only to a small fraction of the total N content in both species even with nutrient supply (maximum 6\% of the total). The N:P ratio (6–8 w/w) in the algae was unaffected by the nutrient exposure in both experiments. In experiment 1, elevated nutrients decreased the content of ß-glucans from 11.2\% (w/w) to 4.1\% (w/w) in S. latissima while it was unaffected in L. digitata (about 5\% w/w). Iodide content decreased to about half in the nutrient-rich, brackish water in S. latissima while it was unaffected in L. digitata. Due to the rapid change in the protein content caused by nutrient supply, it was suggested that moving floating kelp-rigs to nutrient-rich locations could be used to enhance the protein content of the algae prior to harvest. Since nitrate uptake was found to take place also in darkness, a cultivation system that can be submerged to deeper nutrient-rich fjord water during night and brought up to the surface at daytime was suggested.},

	abstract = {Net primary production ({NPP}) is influenced by disturbance-driven fluctuations in foliar standing crop ({FSC}) and resource-driven fluctuations in rates of recruitment and growth, yet most studies of {NPP} have focused primarily on factors influencing growth. We quantified {NPP}, {FSC}, recruitment, and growth rate for the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, at three kelp forests in southern California, {USA}, over a 54-month period and determined the relative roles of {FSC}, recruitment, and growth rate in contributing to variation in annual {NPP}. Net primary production averaged between 0.42 and 2.38 kg dry mass·m−2·yr−1 at the three sites. The initial {FSC} present at the beginning of the growth year and the recruitment of new plants during the year explained 63\% and 21\% of the interannual variation observed in {NPP}, respectively. The previous year's {NPP} and disturbance from waves collectively accounted for 80\% of the interannual variation in initial {FSC}. No correlation was found between annual growth rate (i.e., the amount of new kelp mass produced per unit of existing kelp mass) and annual {NPP} (i.e., the amount of new kelp mass produced per unit area of ocean bottom), largely because annual growth rate was consistent compared to initial {FSC} and recruitment, which fluctuated greatly among years and sites. Although growth rate was a poor predictor of variation in annual {NPP}, it was principally responsible for the high mean values observed for {NPP} by Macrocystis. These high mean values reflected rapid growth (average of ∼2\% per day) of a relatively small standing crop (maximum annual mean = 444 g dry mass/m2) that replaced itself approximately seven times per year. Disturbance-driven variability in {FSC} may be generally important in explaining variation in {NPP}, yet it is rarely examined because cycles of disturbance and recovery occur over timescales of decades or more in many systems. Considerable insight into how variation in {FSC} drives variation in {NPP} may be gained by studying systems such as giant kelp forests that are characterized by frequent disturbance and rapid rates of growth and recruitment.},

	abstract = {Kelp forests are the foundation of Australia’s Great Southern Reef and create food and shelter for various marine organisms. In Australia, as well as globally, kelp forests are declining due to the direct and indirect effects of climate change, and one main driver of kelp decline is rising seawater temperatures. Lessonia corrugata is an endemic Tasmanian kelp that forms dense shallow, subtidal forests, but despite being an important habitat forming species it is relatively unstudied. Importantly, we know little about its thermal tolerance and the temperature conditions necessary for optimal performance. We investigated the performance of L. corrugata at 7 temperatures (4, 7, 10, 14, 17, 20 and 22°C) to construct thermal performance curves ({TPCs}). We further explored how inorganic nitrogen influences thermal performance and assessed other physiological traits including carbon to nitrogen ratio, fatty acid contents, antioxidants, and pigments. Through understanding a species thermal tolerance, we can predict whether increases in temperature may push species beyond their limits and improve our understanding of their vulnerability to a warming climate. This is especially important for the Great Southern Reef, which is both a global hotspot of macroalgae and temperate biodiversity, but also a hotspot of global ocean warming.},

	abstract = {The nitrate uptake capacity of mature blade tissue of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C. Ag., was examined as a function of the availability of light and nitrate. Time course measurements indicated that nitrate uptake rate, as measured by the incorporation of 15N, was significantly increased by N starvation. The response was linear over the first hour of exposure regardless of the N status of the tissue indicating that surge uptake was not responsible for the increase. The Michaelis-Menten parameters Vmax and Ks, however, were not significantly changed by either growth nitrate concentration or growth irradiance as a result of high variability among blades. Similarly, the initial slope (α) of the nitrate uptake kinetics curves was unaffected. Concentration of photosynthetic pigments increased in response to increased nitrate availability but not to increased growth irradiance. Time course and pigment data demonstrated that mature blade tissue responds to increased N availability by decreasing its capacity to take up nitrate and by increasing its investment in photosynthetic pigments, perhaps for N storage or enhanced light-harvesting capabilities and the increase in reducing power available for N assimilation. This study provides evidence for a dynamic regulatory system that responds to changes in nitrate availability in an integrated manner.},

	abstract = {Macrocystis pyrifera (Giant Kelp) forests form important habitats in temperate coastal regions. Hydrodynamics control the transport of nutrients, food particles, larvae and spores at scales ranging from boundary layers around individual blades to entire kelp forests. Our measurements include vertical profiles of current and temperature, and concurrent wave measurements, at a number of different locations in and around a kelp forest at Santa Cruz, California. We find that flow at the site is dominated by variations at diurnal and semidiurnal frequencies. A vertically sheared across-shore flow, consistent with flow driven by an across-shore density gradient, is thought to be important for exchange between the kelp forest and the surrounding coastal ocean. Within the kelp forest, currents are reduced by a factor that correlates with surface canopy coverage, higher frequency internal waves are damped, and onshore transport due to waves (Stokes drift) is estimated to be similar in magnitude to that due to currents. Richardson numbers within the kelp forest are higher than those outside the kelp forest and indicate that the water column within the kelp forest is usually stable to turbulence generation by mean velocity shear.

This review considers how the hydrodynamic environment in which macroalgae grow influences their ability to acquire essential resources and how macroalgae might respond physiologically to fluctuations in their hydrodynamic regime with a focus on: (1) the biochemical processes occurring within the diffusion boundary layer ({DBL}) that might reduce rates of macroalgal production; (2) time scales over which measurements of velocity and {DBL} processes should be made, discussing the likehood of in situ mass transfer limitation; (3) if and how macroalgal morphology influences resource acquisition in slow flows; and (4) ecobiomechanics and how hydrodynamic drag might influence resource acquisition and allocation.

	abstract = {Many activities associated with the expanding blue economy are characterised by high complexity, uncertainty, and significant potential for environmental impacts. In a shared marine environment, these conditions can lead to conflict, with increasingly polarised debate ultimately hindering new development. Key communication determinants of this conflict include: (i) the level of interest in the debate; (ii) the strength of attitudes; (iii) the certainty of attitudes; (iv) the level of trust between stakeholder groups; and (v) gaps in information. Using the Australian salmon industry as an exemplar of aquaculture conflict, we have run a stakeholder survey to measure each of these determinants. Implications for building effective communication strategies have been explored, addressing systemic issues such as legitimacy and credibility of information sources, message discrepancy, and negation of misinformation. The findings suggest that to reduce conflict and build community trust, communication will require targeted long-term strategies, allowing government agencies, aquaculture companies, scientists and communities to inform and be informed. Policies that promote a common dialogue and collective learning with regard to interactions between aquaculture, coastal ecosystems and communities will be critical in shifting the focus from concerns of collusion and secrecy, towards that of engagement and collaboration on impact and trust attributes. Policy makers and research agencies will also need to provide adequate resources, training, and incentives for scientists to expand their role from providing traditional technical advice, to engaging more broadly on contentious socio-ecological issues.},

	abstract = {Seasonal or chronic nutrient limitations in the photic zone limit large-scale cultivation of seaweed (macroalgae) in much of the world's oceans, hindering the development of macroalgae as a biofuel feedstock. One possible solution is to supply nutrients using a diel depth-cycling approach, physically moving the macroalgae between deep nutrient-rich water at night and shallow depths within the photic zone during the day. This study tested the effects of depth-cycling on the growth, morphology, and chemical composition of the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, a target species for renewable biomass production. Giant kelp grown under depth-cycling conditions had an average growth rate of 5\% per day and produced four times more biomass (wet weight) than individuals grown in a kelp bed without depth-cycling. Analysis of tissue from the depth-cycled kelp showed elevated levels of protein, lower C:N ratios, and distinct δ15N and δ13C values suggesting that the depth-cycled kelp were not nitrogen-deficient and assimilated nutrients from deep water. Depth-cycled kelp also exhibited smaller and thicker-walled pneumatocysts and larger blades. Overall, this study supports further investigation of depth-cycling as a macroalgal farming strategy.},

Various extraction techniques are used for conversion of algal biomass into extracts. Recently, attention of scientists has been paid to novel methods, such as enzyme-assisted extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, pressurized liquid extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, and ultrasound-assisted extraction, which enable the extraction of biologically active compounds without their degradation. In this review, the properties of biologically active compounds extracted from the biomass of algae reported in the literature are presented in a structured way. Algal extracts contain compounds such as carbohydrates, proteins, minerals, oil, fats, polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as bioactive compounds such as antioxidants (polyphenols, tocopherols [vitamin E], vitamin C, mycosporine-like amino acids), and pigments, such as carotenoids (carotene xanthophyll), chlorophylls, and phycobilins (phycocyanin, phycoerythrin), which possess antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor properties. Finally, we assemble a list of applications of algal extracts in different developing branches of agriculture (biostimulants, bioregulators, feed additives) and in pharmaceutical industry.},

Agardh (Ochrophyta), also known as giant kelp, is a key species in coastal ecosystems of temperate regions worldwide providing important habitats and food for a range of species. M. pyrifera also has the potential for cultivation for commercial application (e.g. food, food additives and feed). This study compared the effect of proximity to Atlantic salmon aquaculture sites (proximal and distal) on the nutritional value (proximate composition, fatty acids, and dietary minerals) and metal profiling of wild M. pyrifera populations applying standard procedures for proximate composition (Kjeldahl procedure with N × 5 for protein, cold extraction using dichloromethane: methanol (2:1) for lipid, oven drying for moisture, incineration in a muffle furnace for ash, and carbohydrate content calculated by difference), esterification for fatty acid and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry ({ICP}-{MS}) for minerals and metals. Lipid contents and some fatty acids ({FA}, e.g. polyunsaturated fatty acids ({PUFAs})) were higher in samples proximal to salmon farms; however, concentrations of lipids were low overall ({\textless}1.5\% of dry weight). Moisture was consistently higher in distal samples, while the effects of proximity to salmon cages on the concentrations of protein, ash, and carbohydrates (as nitrogen-free extract) were not consistent amongst regions. Iodine levels did not vary between proximal and distal samples, while differences were reported for other elements between the investigated sites, particularly for phosphorous, iron, sodium, and potassium. Overall, metals including aluminium, arsenic, lead, cadmium, and mercury, were low and do not represent a concern for human consumption. These findings help to understand the potential of farming M. pyrifera in combination with finfish aquaculture in southern Australia for nutrient remediation from the finfish aquaculture, and aid in identifying possible commercial applications for M. pyrifera in the Australian market, including food, feed, fertiliser, and nutraceuticals.},

Micronutrient uptake rates of mature blade tissue were determined using the appropriate radionuclide in artificial seawater. Cellular uptake was distinguished from free space uptake by the use of suitable wash solutions. The uptake rates were then transposed to conditions in the sea, with several assumptions being made. Micronutrient content was determined for mature blade tissue before and after treatment to remove extracellular micronutrients. A mathematical description of frond growth was developed from previously published data and used to derive equations relating micronutrient assimilation (tissue incorporation) and uptake by fronds, both expressed in mg·d−1, to frond length. Calculations revealed that at a certain frond length xi assimilation equaled uptake for Mn, Co, and Fe. Uptake was greater than assimilation for fronds longer than xi and less than assimilation for fronds shorter than xi. This indicated that Mn, Co, and Fe translocation was required from fronds longer than xi to fronds shorter than xi. The large assimilation values at xi for Mn and Co further indicate that these elements, at times, may limit Macrocystis growth. Calculations also showed that Cu, Zn, Mo, I, and Ni uptake was greater than their assimilation for all frond lengths, which suggested that these elements are transported to other tissues for storage (e.g. in holdfast) or release (e.g. from frond apices).},

	abstract = {This paper analyses nutrient conversions, which are taking place in integrated intensive aquaculture systems. In these systems fish is cultured next to other organisms, which are converting otherwise discharged nutrients into valuable products. These conversions are analyzed based on nitrogen and phosphorous balances using a mass balance approach. The analytical concept of this review comprises a hypothetical system design with five modules: (1) the conversion of feed nutrients into fish biomass, the "Fish-Biomass- Converter"; (2) the separation of solid and dissolved fish waste/nutrients; the "Fish-Waste-Processor"; (3) the conversion of dissolved fish waste/nutrients, the "Phototrophic-herbivore-Converter"; (4 and 5) the conversion of solid fish waste, the "Bacterial-Waste-Converter", or the "Detrivorous-Converter". In the reviewed examples, fish culture alone retains 20-50\% feed nitrogen (N) and 15-65\% feed phosphorous (P). The combination of fish culture with phototrophic conversion increases nutrient retention of feed N by 15-50\% and feed P by up to 53\%. If in addition herbivore consumption is included, nutrient retention decreases by 60-85\% feed N and 50-90\% feed P. This is according to the general observation of nutrient losses from one trophic level to the next. The conversion of nutrients into bacteria and detrivorous worm biomass contributes only in smaller margins (e.g. 7\% feed N and 6\% feed P and 0.06\% feed N 0.03 × 10-3\% feed P, respectively). All integrated modules have their specific limitations, which are related to uptake kinetics, nutrient preference, unwanted conversion processes and abiotic factors. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {In many temperate, rocky-reef coastal ecosystems, kelp forests modify alongshore currents, impact invertebrate settlement, and regulate understory algal abundances. Along the southern coasts of Alaska, in particular, two species of canopy-forming kelps with dissimilar morphologies, Nereocystis luetkeana and Eualaria fistulosa, co-occur but vary in their distributions and patterns of abundance, with one species often replacing the other at given sites in subsequent years. As a result, their differences in morphology may affect patterns of current flow through the forests, which could have strong impacts on invertebrate settlement and benthic diversity, particularly in Kachemak Bay, Alaska (59° 36′33{ʺN}, 151° 20′51{ʺW}), which experiences large tidal fluctuations resulting in strong alongshore currents. In this study, significant differences in current reductions were observed between the two kelp forest types within Kachemak Bay, but these reductions were small compared to the natural spatiotemporal variability of currents within the bay, and they were primarily limited to the upper few meters of the water column where the two species exhibit their greatest differences in morphology. Consequently, invertebrate settlement and abundance differed between the two kelp forest types as well as among study sites within the bay. In addition, there were differences observed in the composition and abundance of understory algae between the two forest types, which were presumably due to differences in shading abilities of the dominant kelps. Together, our results suggest that future changes in the distribution and abundances of these two kelp forest types may result in corresponding changes in hydrodynamic conditions within the forests, and thereby impact invertebrate and benthic algal assemblages.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Coastal protection from erosion and flooding is a significant ecosystem service provided by vegetated marine systems. Kelp beds are a dominant habitat-forming species on temperate reefs worldwide. While they are valued as hotspots of biodiversity, there is a paucity of information that supports their use in nature-based coastal defence. This includes the effectiveness of kelp beds in attenuating waves approaching the shore and how this influences sediment transport. Methods Wave loggers were deployed at paired kelp bed and control (urchin barren) treatments at four sites in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. The significant wave height offshore (exposed side) to onshore (sheltered side) of the treatment were compared to determine wave attenuation. Key Results At three sites, the wave attenuation of kelp beds was significantly less than that of the control. This result was consistent across the environmental conditions recorded in this study. At the fourth site, on average there was no significant difference in wave transmission between kelp and control. However, wave attenuation at kelp beds was 10 \% greater than the control during periods of northerly winds. We highlight the importance of disentangling the effects of the reef substratum and kelp when evaluating the efficacy of kelp at providing coastal protection. Conclusions We have highlighted a significant gap in the research on ecosystem services provided by kelp beds. A greater understanding is needed on which kelp species are able to provide coastal protection, and under what conditions. Such future research is essential for providing managers and policy makers with actionable information on sustainable and cost-effective solutions for coastal defence when faced with a changing climate.},

	abstract = {It is generally acknowledged that bottom vegetation enhances the damping of surface waves in shallow waters. Thus the harvesting of kelp forests by trawling and associated change of conditions have given rise to conflicts. In order to secure a scientifically good basis for management ofthe marine resources and the environment, the role of the kelp forest as habitat for fish and marine animals and the wave damping effect need to be investigated and quantified. The hydrodynamical conditions in a kelp forest have been investigated with aid of ultrasonic current meters ({UCMs}) attached to bottom mounted rigs. Data sampling at a rate of 2 Hz of the three velocity components and pressure ensured adequate frequency resolution of the energy containing surface waves of 5-15 sec. periods. Analysis of frequency spectra of wave energy suggested a new main mechanism of wave damping giving a model which has been formulated mathematically and compared with observations. Wave attenuation by kelp forests in shallow waters has been substantiated by measurements at Hustadvika at a site which is strongly exposed to waves from the open ocean. The reduction of wave energy from the outer to inner part of kelp belt over a distance of 258 m was 70-85 \% with highest value at low tide. Velocity measurements at two levels, above and below canopy, reveal almost identical results. This remarkable documentation contradicts earlier assumptions and findings concerning sheltering effect of kelp, i.e. Eckman \& al. (1989). The working hypothesis of the present analysis is that the viscous drag of the kelp fronds is the dominating factor. The results from the corresponding mathematical model are in good agreement with observations. The wave conditions in a kelp forest have been measured and modelled. The results of the experiment provide a good basis for evaluation of wave damping effects and may be compared with laboratory experiments and field investigations after harvesting. © 1996 Taylor \& Francis Group, {LLC}.},

In a series of experiments on recruitment of invertebrates, I partitioned the habitat- modifying effects of kelp into their positive and negative effects. Experiments revealed that a reduction of light intensity and removal of sediment by canopies acted to facilitate recruitment, but physical abrasion by the canopy acted as a negative force to overpower these positive effects. Understorey assemblages, therefore, represent biased subsets of taxa from a local pool capable of colonization. On balance, negative effects acted to exclude invertebrates from the understorey community. The asymmetric strength of negative effects not only explains the enigma of exclusion but also indicates that, when it exists, understorey coexistence with canopy plants must reflect a more even match between positive and negative effects.},

Relative to more exposed rocky substrata at identical depths, bottoms beneath kelp canopies were exposed to weak fluid transport and were characterized by greater rates of deposition of particulates. A tracer particle experiment demonstrated that kelps inhibited transport of suspended particles from the overlying water column to the bottom. Thus, the higher rates ofparticulate deposition beneath kelp canopies probably were caused by longer particle residence times and higher probabilities of particulate redeposition beneath canopies and not by higher rates ofparticle import. These hydrodynamic effects may play important roles in the ecology of animals that inhabit understory kelp environments. We propose several potential effects of flow modification by kelps on larval recruitment and dispersal and growth of suspension-feeders.},

	abstract = {The effects of a Macrocystis pyrifera forest on currents and turbulence were investigated in a controlled laboratory setting using a dynamically matched 1/25-scale model. Two kelp configurations with surface canopies and one without a surface canopy were considered. Profiles of mean velocities and turbulence statistics were measured using acoustic Doppler velocimeters. Since flow within the model kelp forest was very heterogeneous, spatially averaged forms of the governing equations were used for the analysis. Stress gradients were small compared with pressure gradient, drag, and acceleration terms of the momentum budget. A good model for kelp drag is therefore required for simulating flow through a kelp forest, while the model for Reynolds and dispersive stresses is less critical. The bulk drag coefficient is highest at the up-current end of a kelp forest and decays with down-current distance as the velocity profile adjusts to the drag profile. Modeling a kelp forest as an array of vertical cylinders underestimates the net drag by a factor of 1.5 to 3 if a substantial surface canopy is present. Turbulence is generated predominantly by small-scale shear in kelp wakes. Vertical mixing of scalars is expected to be significantly smaller than in the surrounding coastal ocean because of the combination of smaller turbulent eddies and reduced currents. The decrease in horizontal transport and vertical mixing within kelp forests may have important implications for nutrient availability to kelp forest organisms and may affect the dispersal or retention of their larvae and spores.},

	abstract = {Kelp aquaculture is one of the most important exploitation and utilization activities in coastal areas. The impacts of high-density kelp aquaculture on coastal area environments are attracting increasing attention. Based on in situ data from the suspended kelp aquaculture area of Heini Bay, numerical simulations were applied to distinguish hydrodynamic and sediment transport features under natural and aquaculture conditions. By comparing model simulations with observations, the calibrated models reflected the hydrodynamic conditions and sedimentary environments in Heini Bay well. Although the kelp scenario model was calibrated by data measured in an early stage of aquaculture and produced a relatively conservative result, the model was able to simulate the trend of sedimentary environment changes in the aquaculture area. The results of the simulations indicated that, after the occurrence of aquaculture activities, the average velocity was reduced by approximately 21\% in the waters around Chu Island and Moye Island, and by 50\% within the kelp aquaculture area. Along the western edges of the aquaculture area (i.e., the nearshore area), the average velocity barely changed, but the instantaneous velocity during the flood/ebb tide may increase by up to 3 times. The annual maximum erosion rate around Chu Island, Moye Island and Heishi Reef decreased by approximately 30\%, and the total range of the erosion area where the erosion intensity was not less than 0.01 m/yr decreased by almost 36\%. The deposition area in Heini Bay shifted to deeper waters, and almost the entire kelp aquaculture area was in a deposition state. However, the deposition rates in the aquaculture area were reduced accordingly.},

	abstract = {The water flow rates w ilhin mussel rafts in Saldanha Bay were measured and related to hydrodynamic forcing (in terms of ambient flow in the farm) and raft specifications. Currents within and in the vicinity of the mussel farm were highly variable in speed and direction and were subject to wind and tidal forcing, as well as bay resonances. The rafts affected the water flow in three ways: most of the flow diverged around a raft: within a raft, the flow tended to align along one of its major axes; and within the raft, the water was retarded. Retardation appeared to depend on ambient flow speed and was statistically related to mussel rope spacing. Velocities of 7.5 cm/s and 1.25 cm/s within the farm and rafts, respectively, are suggested as the most appropriate values for calculating the food supply rates required by associated studies. The effect of a similar farm on downstream advection velocities is modeled considering a uniform flow, and possible future ad{\textbackslash}ection limitations on a designated new lease area are discussed.},

The hydrodynamic regimes in the sidearms and embayments in Pelorus Sound are dominated by the lunar tide, and a net estuarine circulation in the main channel flowing inwards along the bottom and outwards along the top. Salinity gradients extend throughout the sound from the river inflows, with strongest density stratification in the sidearms and embayments: nearest the head of the sound. There, the water column is separated at the pycnocline into upper and lower layers which tend to move in different directions or at different velocities. Local circulation patterns modify tidal flushing patterns, producing extended residence times in some embayments, whereas other embayments off the side of the main channel tend to be flushed more rapidly by through‐flow water and have shorter residence times than would otherwise be expected. The changing inflow of fresh water modifies the local hydraulic regimes in the inner sounds, especially during flood conditions. © Crown copyright 1991.},

	abstract = {In the context of aquaculture, carrying capacity is generally understood as the standing stock of a particular species at which production is maximised without negatively affecting growth rates. The estimation of carrying capacity for aquaculture is a complex issue. That complexity stems from the many interactions between and among cultivated and non-cultivated species, as well as between those species and their physical and chemical environments. Mathematical models may help to resolve these interactions, by analysing them in a dynamic manner. Previous carrying capacity models have considered the biogeochemical processes that influence growth of cultivated species in great detail. However, physical processes tend to have been addressed very simplistically. Further, most modelling has been for monocultures, despite the increasing importance of multi-species (=polyculture) systems. We present here a two-dimensional coupled physical-biogeochemical model implemented for Sungo Bay, Shandong Province, People's Republic of China. Sungo Bay is used for extensive polyculture, where bivalve shellfish and kelp are the most important cultivated species. Data collected over 13 years (1983-2000) was available for modelling. Our main objectives were to implement the model, achieving reasonable calibration and validation with independent data sets, for use in estimating the environmental carrying capacity for polyculture of scallops and oysters. Findings indicate that the model successfully reproduces some of the main features of the simulated system. Although requiring some further work to improve predictive capability in parts, predictions clearly indicate that Sungo Bay is being exploited close to the environmental carrying capacity for suspension-feeding shellfish. Comparison of different culture scenarios also indicates that any significant increase in yield will depend largely on a more optimal spatial distribution of the different cultivated species. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Effects of long-line mussel farms on flow structure have been studied in this paper. Experiments in a tidal basin facility on Froude scaled long-lines were used to better understand how droppers impact flows. The observations demonstrate that flow speeds within the long-line is reduced by 25-30\% from ambient, and material transport to downstream droppers is significantly reduced. These results suggest that neglecting the physical barrier imposed by the aquaculture installations will result in a considerable overestimation of nutrient supply to the bivalve and thus an overestimation of carrying capacity. An existing two-dimensional depth integrated model has been refined to better predict hydrodynamics and solute transport within suspended aquaculture farms. The numerical model has been refined to include both the form drag imparted by the individual mussel droppers and the blockage effect that the suspended canopy presents. Additional turbulent kinetic energy production is incorporated into the two equation k-e\{open\} closure model. Data collated in the laboratory was used to calibrate and validate the numerical model. It has been demonstrated that predicted velocities and solute transport correlate well with experimental results. The numerical model was applied to a designated aquaculture site on the West Coast of Ireland, Casheen Bay. The effect of long-lines on hydrodynamics and solute transport was analysed. Flushing studies were used to study particle renewal terms in the embayment. Several flushing characteristics were calculated, including, the average residence time and the exchange per tidal cycle coefficient. The viability of using relatively simple flushing studies formulae to assess the development potential of small scale aquaculture projects is discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The parameter estimation code, {PEST}, was used to optimize various model parameters including horizontal momentum diffusivity, vertical eddy viscosity, turbulence closure constants, and, most importantly, depth-dependent drag coefficients. An increasing average drag coefficient was observed with decreasing canopy blockage ratio, and an empirical relationship for the vertical variation of drag coefficient was developed that may be appropriate for use in full-scale models of aquaculture systems. Overall, the calibrated canopy-turbulence parameters and drag-coefficient empiricisms may yield improved predictions of alterations to hydrodynamic and nutrient-transport conditions due to various aquaculture structures. Such predictions will help develop methods to minimize environmental impacts and to increase production from aquaculture farms.},

	abstract = {The coastal waters around the Yangma Island are an important mariculture area of raft-raised scallop and bottom-seeded sea cucumber in the North Yellow Sea, China. Large-scale hypoxia in the bottom water of this area has caused the death of a large number of sea cucumbers and heavy economic losses. To find out the formation mechanism of hypoxia, the data obtained in each August during 2015-2018 were analyzed. Compared with the non-hypoxic year (2018), the temperature, trophic index ({TRIX}) and dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) in the bottom water were relatively higher, and the water column was stratified causing by continuous high air temperature and low wind speed meteorological conditions in the hypoxic years (2015-2017). These sites with the coexistence of thermocline and halocline, and the thickness of thermocline {\textgreater}2.5 m and its upper boundary {\textgreater}7.0 m deep, were prone to hypoxia. Spatially, the hypoxic place was highly consistent with the scallop cultivating places, and the {DOC}, {TRIX}, {NH}4+/{NO}3- and apparent oxygen utilization ({AOU}) at the culture sites were higher, indicating that organic matter and nutrients released by scallops may lead to local oxygen depletion. In addition, the bottom water of the culture sites had higher salinity, but lower turbidity and temperature, indicating that the slowed water exchange caused by scallop culture was a dynamic factor of hypoxia. All sites with {AOU} {\textgreater}4 mg/L at the bottom had hypoxia occurrence, even if there was no thermocline. In other words, stratification promoted the formation of hypoxia in coastal bottom water, but it was not indispensable. The raft-raised scallop culture could promote the formation of coastal hypoxia, which should arouse the attention for other coastal areas with intensive bivalve production.},

	abstract = {A field and modeling study of the food supply and demand of mussel (Mytilus edulis) rafts in Maine established the hydrodynamic and particle consumption characteristics of shellfish aquaculture structures. Mussels on rafts filtered about 8 × 106 L/h and consumed about 40 g chlorophyll a (chl a)/h under favorable conditions. Because of the drag of the culture ropes and predator nets, velocity inside the rafts was reduced by 75\%–80\% in relation to ambient conditions. Chlorophyll consumption by mussels increased with increased food (chl a) concentration and also with increased water velocity inside the rafts. Clearance rates per raft also increased with food concentration. Model results allow for an estimation of water flux and seston depletion within the rafts through the use of point measurements and correction factors. Water velocity measurements taken mid depth in the middle of the rafts underestimated the mean flow through the raft by 10\%. Measurements of current velocity and chl a concentration taken mid depth in the middle of the rafts underestimated the mean particle consumption rates by 13\%. Model results and field data indicate that mussel raft hydrodynamics are a function of raft orientation to current direction, mussel raft size, raft aspect ratio, the presence of predator nets, the presence of multiple rafts, rope spacing, and rope diameter. Mussel raft design, placement, and biomass may be adjusted to optimize hydrodynamics and conditions favorable for improved mussel growth rates. Recommended flow speeds through experimental mussel rafts with a cross-sectional area of 121 m2 require a minimum outside flow speed of 14–23 cm/sec.},

Even though seston flux to the scallops was reduced by 40\% due to the attenuation of flow by culture gear, a reduction in seston concentration was not observed. The field data were then used to parameterize a quasi two-dimensional advection-diffusion model that quantified the relationship between the tidally driven seston supply and consumption by scallops. The model predicted a minimal reduction in seston concentration ({\textless}5\%) within the lease (80 x 50 m), consistent with field observations. However, expanding the lease to occupy the area available for cultivation (1000 x 250 m) reduced the seston concentration in the centre of the lease by 20-50\%, potentially limiting growth. Modelling results emphasized that by altering the lease geometry (lease width to length ratio), the supply of seston can be optimized.},

The growth conditions of the site directly impact the biomass yield and composition of the crop, which in turn control the conversion efficiency of biomass to bioenergy. This review focuses on three European brown phaeophyte kelp species which may be suitable for large-scale offshore cultivation: Laminaria digitata, Saccharina latissima and Sacchoriza polyschides. It describes the known responses of each to a number of important physical and chemical parameters: temperature, salinity, water motion, nutrient concentrations, carbon dioxide/{pH}, light and ultra-violet radiation. It also reports density effects on their growth rate and what is known concerning the impact of disease and grazing. Conclusions are made on the conditions necessary for the optimal growth of each species for biofuel production. Where conditions are sub-optimal, this review has made recommendations for the most suitable species for a particular set of environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture ({IMTA}) is an effective method for sustainable aquaculture as species from different trophic levels could reduce negative effects from fed species in the environment. A proper proportion of different trophic species in an {IMTA} system could improve the aquaculture production and environmental sustainability. At present, research on the proper proportions for farming species is scarce. We investigated the effects of {IMTA} modes of oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and kelp (Saccharina japonica) in different weight ratios on water quality and carbonate system in a closed enclosure experiment for three days in the Sanggou Bay in Shandong Province, China, in December 2017. Nine collocation modes in oyster:kelp weight ratio were tested showing as 24:3, 24:2, 24:1, 16:3, 16:2, 16:1, 8:3, 8:2, and 8:1. The water parameters were determined at 17:00 on Day 1 (D1), and 6:00 and 17:00 on Days 2 (D2) and 3 (D3). As two-way {ANOVA} showed, all increased parameters (dissolved oxygen ({DO}), {pH}, chl a, the carbonate system and p {CO}2) were significantly related to oyster-kelp modes, and interaction between modes and time were also significant (P{\textless}0.05). On the 3 th day, the 8:3 mode was the highest in {DO}, {pH}, chl a, {CO}32− (P{\textless}0.05), and dissolved inorganic carbon ({DIC}), {HCO}3−, {CO}2 and {pCO}2 were the lowest (P{\textless}0.05). According to previous references and the results of this study, the appropriate oyster:kelp proportion at the beginning of winter is from 8:2 to 8:3. The results of this study may help government to optimize the aquaculture structure of Sanggou Bay.},

	abstract = {Effects of aquaculture on hydrodynamics and associated nutrient supply in a typical aquaculture area of the coastal Yellow Sea are investigated with high-resolution model experiments and in situ data. The results show a significant reduction in nutrient supply, which is associated with alternations of three hydrodynamic conditions: the onshore current across the outer-boundary of aquaculture area, upwelling within the offshore (depth {\textgreater}10 m) aquaculture area, and water exchange in the near-coastal (depth {\textless}10 m) aquaculture area. First, the onshore current in the bottom layer of the aquaculture boundary, which transports high-concentration nutrients from the major nutrient source of offshore bottom water, is significantly weakened by suspended aquaculture. As a result, nutrient supply from offshore sources is reduced by 50\%−60\%. Second, the upwelling velocities in the offshore aquaculture area are reduced by 2–6 × 10−3 cm/s, which leads to an approximately 25\% reduction in nutrient supply to the euphotic layer. Third, the water exchange in the near-coastal aquaculture area remains approximately unchanged because the weakened onshore currents within the aquaculture layers (0–4 m) are compensated by the enhanced onshore currents in the lower layers. As a result, the nutrient supply in the near-coastal aquaculture area does not significantly change, whereas the nutrient supply in the offshore aquaculture area has been reduced by approximately 60\%.},

In the most highly studied canopy-forming kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera (the giant kelp), models of hydrodynamic and oceanographic phenomena influencing spore movement provide bounds on reproduction, quantify patterns of local and regional propagule supply, identify scales of population connectivity, and establish context for agents of early life mortality. Other analyses yield insight into flow-mediated species interactions within kelp forests. In each case, advances emerge from the use of ecomechanical approaches that propagate physical-biological connections at the scale of the individual to higher levels of ecological organization. In systems where physical factors strongly influence population, community or ecosystem properties, such mechanics-based methods promote crucial progress but are just beginning to realize their full potential.},

	abstract = {As a result of nutrient loading from septic systems, a thick canopy of macroalgae covers the bottom of Waquoit Bay, an embayment on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Using automated conductivity-temperature-oxygen recorders and manual profiles, we measured diel water column O2 changes during summer in the Childs River, the estuary of the bay with the highest housing density. At dawn in midsummer, bottom waters in the Childs River are chronically hypoxic due to high rates of benthic respiration. On sunny days benthic photosynthesis drives bottom water O2 to 10-15 mg l-1 by afternoon. The extent of the daily O2 excursion is directly proportional to daily irradiance. Large diel O2 excursions in bottom water are due to limited mixing of surface and bottom water. Density stratification exceeded two sigma-t units 85\% of the time during midsummer in the Childs River. Because of stratification, hypoxia and even anoxia occur in this estuary. The first of several anoxic events was observed in Waquoit Bay in 1988, and we have attempted to evaluate factors that trigger anoxia. High rates of benthic respiration result in anoxia when replenishment of O2 during the day is limited by insufficient light. Our analysis of meteorological records during two recent anoxic events shows that anoxia develops overnight in midsummer during periods of peak summertime temperatures after several days of cloudy, moderately calm weather. Similarly critical conditions existed most summers since 1975, yet anoxic events in the bay have not been reported historically. If climatic warming occurs, anoxic events in the bay may occur more frequently even if algal stocks remain unchanged. Eutrophication of Waquoit Bay is similar to many other embayments in populated coastal areas, and anoxic events may indicate a chronic growing problem in these important ecosystems. However, in shallow, stratified embayments, anoxia may be transient and easily missed without frequent monitoring.},

	abstract = {Mariculture has rapidly grown worldwide, which might greatly influence the biogeochemical cycle of organic carbon in coastal seas. In this study, several geochemical parameters, including grain size composition, sedimentary total organic carbon ({TOC}), total nitrogen ({TN}), stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotopic compositions, were analyzed for surface sediments collected from different mariculture zones of Sanggou Bay and in different seasons. We investigated the composition and distribution of organic matter in surface sediments and further evaluated the contribution of mariculture activities to {TOC} sources. The {TOC} and {TN} contents (mass percentage) in the bay were in the range of 0.14\% to 1.45\% and 0.03\% to 0.20\%, respectively. The spatial distribution indicated that sedimentary {TOC} and {TN} contents in shellfish monoculture and shellfish-kelp polyculture zones were higher than in other mariculture zones, which might be related to grain size composition and mariculture organisms. Seasonal variations of {TOC} contents were observed in different mariculture zones. The {TOC}/{TN} atomic ratio (C/N), δ13C and δ15N were in the ranges of 5.97 to 10.97, −21.76‰ to −13.14‰ and 2.13‰ to 8.08‰, respectively, implying that sedimentary organic matter in Sanggou Bay was the mixture of marine phytoplankton, terrestrial and maricultural sources. A simple mixing model based on δ13C was applied and the results indicated that the relative contributions of organic carbon sources in Sanggou Bay followed the order kelp (36.6\%) {\textgreater} marine phytoplankton (28.7\%) {\textgreater} shellfish bio-deposition (23.8\%) {\textgreater} terrestrial input (10.9\%). Surface sediments in Sanggou Bay were dominated by mariculture-derived organic carbon, which on average accounted for 60.4\% of {TOC}.},

The {MOM} system (Modelling-Ongrowing fish farms-Monitoring) was developed to control the impact of organic waste from marine fish farms in Norway, but it is based on a general concept of environmental management and may be adapted to other fish species and longline shellfish or seaweed farming by adjusting parameters and techniques. 10 sampling station were set and a total of 66 sediment samples were collected. Seasonal variations in three groups of parameters were compared, but no significant differences were detected between the different culture species sites. Benthic animals were found in all samples, and the redox potential stayed above +50 {mV}. The sediment conditions according to the Groups 2 and 3 parameters of the {MOM}-system were compared. The results suggest that the Sungou Bay benthic environment belong to condition 1 or 2, which means that the effects of long term shellfish and seaweed farming activities on the benthic environment of Sungou Bay were low. But the result also showed that the impacts in summer and autumn are likely to be greater than in winter and spring. More studies need to be performed to adjust the investigation to Chinese conditions and to shellfish farming, so as to form an adequate system for China.

However, many claims of the social and ecological benefits from seaweed farming have limited or contextually weak empirical grounding. Here we systematically review relevant publications across four languages to form a comprehensive picture of observed—rather than theorised—social and environmental impacts of seaweed farming globally. We show that, while some impacts such as improved water quality and coastal livelihoods are consistently reported, other promulgated benefits vary across cultivation contexts or are empirically unsubstantiated. For some communities, increasing dependence on seaweed farming may improve or worsen the cultural fabric and their vulnerability to economic and environmental shocks. The empirical evidence for the impacts of seaweed farming is also restricted geographically, mainly to East Asia and South-East Asia, and taxonomically. Seaweed farming holds strong potential to contribute to sustainability objectives, but the social and ecological risks associated with scaling up global production remain only superficially understood. These risks require greater attention to ensure just, equitable, and sustainable seaweed industries can be realised.},

	abstract = {Marine aquaculture has the potential to increase its contribution to the global food system and provide valuable ecosystem services, but appropriate planning, licensing and regulation systems must be in place to enable sustainable development. At present, approaches vary considerably throughout the world, and several national and regional investigations have highlighted the need for reforms if marine aquaculture is to fulfil its potential. This article aims to map and evaluate the challenges of planning and licensing for growth of sustainable marine aquaculture. Despite the range of species, production systems and circumstances, this study found a number of common themes in the literature; complicated and fragmented approaches to planning and licensing, property rights and the licence to operate, competition for space and marine spatial planning, emerging species and diversifying marine aquaculture production (seaweed production, Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture [{IMTA}], nutrient and carbon offsetting with aquaculture, offshore aquaculture and co-location and multiuse platforms), and the need to address knowledge gaps and use of decision-support tools. Planning and licensing can be highly complicated, so the {UK} is used as a case study to show more detailed examples that highlight the range of challenges and uncertainty that industry, regulators and policymakers face across interacting jurisdictions. There are many complexities, but this study shows that many countries have undergone, or are undergoing, similar challenges, suggesting that lessons can be learned by sharing knowledge and experiences, even across different species and production systems, rather than having a more insular focus.},

	abstract = {The marine aquaculture sector is growing rapidly. Offshore aquaculture installations have been drawing increasing attention from researchers, industry and policy makers as a promising opportunity for large-scale expansion of the aquaculture industry. Simultaneously, there has also been increased interest in both land-based and nearshore aquaculture systems which combine fed aquaculture species (e.g. finfish), with inorganic extractive aquaculture species (e.g. seaweeds) and organic extractive species (e.g. suspension- and deposit-feeders) cultivated in proximity. Such systems, described as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}), should increase significantly the sustainability of aquaculture, based on a number of potential economic, societal and environmental benefits, including the recycling of waste nutrients from higher trophic-level species into production of lower trophic-level crops of commercial value. Several of the challenges facing {IMTA} in nearshore environments, are also relevant for offshore aquaculture; moreover, the exposed nature of the open ocean adds a number of technical and economic challenges. A variety of technologies have been developed to deal with these constraints in offshore environments, but there remains a number of challenges in designing farm sites that will allow extractive species (e.g. seaweeds and shellfish) to be integrated in fed aquaculture systems and be able to withstand the strong drag forces of open oceans. The development of offshore {IMTA} requires the identification of environmental and economic risks and benefits of such large-scale systems, compared with similarly-scaled monocultures of high trophic-level finfish in offshore systems. The internalizing of economic, societal and environmental costs of finfish monoculture production by the bioremediative services of extractive species in {IMTA} offshore systems should also be examined and analyzed. The results of such investigations will help determine the practical value of adopting the {IMTA} approach as a strategy for the development of offshore aquaculture.},

Norway has an extensive coastline and a well-established aquaculture sector offering suitable preconditions for developing large-scale cultivation of seaweed biomass both in monoculture and in Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture ({IMTA}) systems. Recent efforts from research, industry and public authorities have been committed to develop a Norwegian bio-economy based on cultivated seaweed, focusing on cultivation and processing of the biomass. This review reports on the status of seaweed aquaculture in Norway, supported by production data collected since the delivery of the first commercial cultivation permits at sea in 2014. Although novel product developments are currently limited, future industrial perspectives based on cultivated biomass are being discussed. Upscaling from experimental cultivation schemes to commercial production requires a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits associated with seaweed aquaculture, as well as the development of a regulative framework adapted to this industry. Issues associated with upscaling the macroalgal production that needs to be addressed includes (i) genetic interactions between cultivated and wild crops, (ii) impacts of seaweed cultivation on surrounding ecosystems, (iii) epiphytes and diseases, (iv) area utilization and (v) threats from climate change. Addressing these issues and adapting production practices will ensure the environmental and economic sustainability of an emerging industry based on cultivated seaweed biomass in Norway.},

	abstract = {Marine macro algae may play a significant role in the transformation to the future post fossil fuel and low carbon society. Previous research shows that high expectations for future and large-scale algae cultivation in European waters are often followed by identification of a wide range of challenges linked to the same development. This paper specifically investigates the locational challenges for algae cultivation in spatial planning at the local level along the Norwegian coast. Based on statistics from Norwegian Fisheries Directorate and a survey to Norwegian spatial managers, we explore in detail the challenges for communities, when prioritizing and allocating areas for industrial production of algae. The data suggest some areas for concern that a future upscaling effort would likely need to address. First, the possible encroachment on already established aquaculture should not be underestimated. Uncertainty related to the suitability of areas for algae production combined with a generally more area demanding activity contributes to this. Second, this uncertainty also points to a general knowledge gap on the part of local planners. Finally, the data also suggest other areas for concern that a future upscaling effort would likely need to address, namely that an upscaling of algae production needs to be sensitive to local contexts. The data suggest that a lack of expertise on aquaculture is linked to both lower industry satisfaction, higher levels of conflict, less experience with aquaculture in general, and smaller municipalities.},

First, 2020 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (the Code). Second, several Sustainable Development Goal indicators mature in 2020. Third, {FAO} hosted the International Symposium on Fisheries Sustainability in late 2019, and fourth, 2020 sees the finalization of specific {FAO} guidelines on sustainable aquaculture growth, and on social sustainability along value chains. While Part 1 retains the format of previous editions, the structure of the rest of the publication has been revised. Part 2 opens with a special section marking the twenty fifth anniversary of the Code. It also focuses on issues coming to the fore, in particular, those related to Sustainable Development Goal 14 and its indicators for which {FAO} is the “custodian” agency. In addition, Part 2 covers various aspects of fisheries and aquaculture sustainability. The topics discussed range widely, from data and information systems to ocean pollution, product legality, user rights and climate change adaptation. Part 3 now forms the final part of the publication, covering projections and emerging issues such as new technologies and aquaculture biosecurity. It concludes by outlining steps towards a new vision for capture fisheries. The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture aims to provide objective, reliable and up-to-date information to a wide audience – policymakers, managers, scientists, stakeholders and indeed everyone interested in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.},

	abstract = {As ocean general circulation models ({OGCMs}) move into the petascale age, where the output of single simulations exceeds petabytes of storage space, tools to analyse the output of these models will need to scale up too. Lagrangian ocean analysis, where virtual particles are tracked through hydrodynamic fields, is an increasingly popular way to analyse {OGCM} output, by mapping pathways and connectivity of biotic and abiotic particulates. However, the current software stack of Lagrangian ocean analysis codes is not dynamic enough to cope with the increasing complexity, scale and need for customization of use-cases. Furthermore, most community codes are developed for stand-alone use, making it a nontrivial task to integrate virtual particles at runtime of the {OGCM}. Here, we introduce the new Parcels code, which was designed from the ground up to be sufficiently scalable to cope with petascale computing. We highlight its {API} design that combines flexibility and customization with the ability to optimize for {HPC} workflows, following the paradigm of domain-specific languages. Parcels is primarily written in Python, utilizing the wide range of tools available in the scientific Python ecosystem, while generating low-level C code and using just-in-time compilation for performance-critical computation. We show a worked-out example of its {API}, and validate the accuracy of the code against seven idealized test cases. This version 0.9 of Parcels is focused on laying out the {API}, with future work concentrating on support for curvilinear grids, optimization, efficiency and at-runtime coupling with {OGCMs}.},

One of these tools is Lagrangian ocean analysis, where a set of virtual particles is released and their dynamics are integrated in time based on fields defining the ocean state, including the hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry if available. This popular methodology needs to adapt to the large variety of models producing these fields at different formats.

 This is precisely the aim of Parcels, a Lagrangian ocean analysis framework designed to combine (1) a wide flexibility to model particles of different natures and (2) an efficient implementation in accordance with modern computing infrastructure. In the new Parcels v2.0, we implement a set of interpolation schemes to read various types of discretized fields, from rectilinear to curvilinear grids in the horizontal direction, from z to s levels in the vertical direction and using grid staggering with the Arakawa A, B and C grids. In particular, we develop a new interpolation scheme for a three-dimensional curvilinear C grid and analyse its properties.

 Parcels v2.0 capabilities, including a suite of meta-field objects, are then illustrated in a brief study of the distribution of floating microplastic in the northwest European continental shelf and its sensitivity to various physical processes.},

The integrated multi-trophic aquaculture ({IMTA}) system is a bio-mitigation strategy to alleviate the adverse impacts caused by aquafarming pollutants on the environment and aquatic species. This study provides an overview of the {IMTA} system, explains the interactive processes among the different trophic levels, summarizes the major practices being followed around the temperate coastal waters with a field case study in Japan, and discusses the assessment of {IMTA} bio-mitigation efficiency through experimental greatly dependent on the customs and market values in the local {IMTA} practice. Bio-mitigation efficiency acquired in a land-based experiment exhibits its limitation in approach and conducts a comprehensive analysis on the possibility of applying numerical models to evaluate {IMTA} effectiveness. The selection of a suitable candidate organism is estimating that in the same or different culture conditions with various biomasses of extractive species. However, in open water experiments, it is difficult to evaluate the bio-mitigation effect of extractive species because the initial biomass ratio ({IBR}) of the extractive to target species is too small. Alternatively, the possibility of applying existing numerical models to assess {IMTA} is relatively low. In conclusion, an optimally designed large-scale {IMTA} experiment is required, in which the {IBR} of the extractive to target species is adequately considered, and a full-scale {IMTA} model should be further improved with a database of individual-based submodels for {IMTA} candidate organisms.},

	shorttitle = {Global Patterns in Ecological Indicators of Marine Food Webs},
	abstract = {Background
Ecological attributes estimated from food web models have the potential to be indicators of good environmental status given their capabilities to describe redundancy, food web changes, and sensitivity to fishing. They can be used as a baseline to show how they might be modified in the future with human impacts such as climate change, acidification, eutrophication, or overfishing.

Methodology
In this study ecological network analysis indicators of 105 marine food web models were tested for variation with traits such as ecosystem type, latitude, ocean basin, depth, size, time period, and exploitation state, whilst also considering structural properties of the models such as number of linkages, number of living functional groups or total number of functional groups as covariate factors.

Principal findings
Eight indicators were robust to model construction: relative ascendency; relative overhead; redundancy; total systems throughput ({TST}); primary production/{TST}; consumption/{TST}; export/{TST}; and total biomass of the community. Large-scale differences were seen in the ecosystems of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, with the Western Atlantic being more complex with an increased ability to mitigate impacts, while the Eastern Atlantic showed lower internal complexity. In addition, the Eastern Pacific was less organised than the Eastern Atlantic although both of these systems had increased primary production as eastern boundary current systems. Differences by ecosystem type highlighted coral reefs as having the largest energy flow and total biomass per unit of surface, while lagoons, estuaries, and bays had lower transfer efficiencies and higher recycling. These differences prevailed over time, although some traits changed with fishing intensity. Keystone groups were mainly higher trophic level species with mostly top-down effects, while structural/dominant groups were mainly lower trophic level groups (benthic primary producers such as seagrass and macroalgae, and invertebrates). Keystone groups were prevalent in estuarine or small/shallow systems, and in systems with reduced fishing pressure. Changes to the abundance of key functional groups might have significant implications for the functioning of ecosystems and should be avoided through management.

Conclusion/significance
Our results provide additional understanding of patterns of structural and functional indicators in different ecosystems. Ecosystem traits such as type, size, depth, and location need to be accounted for when setting reference levels as these affect absolute values of ecological indicators. Therefore, establishing absolute reference values for ecosystem indicators may not be suitable to the ecosystem-based, precautionary approach. Reference levels for ecosystem indicators should be developed for individual ecosystems or ecosystems with the same typologies (similar location, ecosystem type, etc.) and not benchmarked against all other ecosystems.},

Average path length for an average inflow (Ā{PL}) is the mean of {APL}1 weighted according to size of the inflows. Ā{PL} is shown to be equal to {TST} divided by the sum of all inflows. {TST} can be partitioned into a portion due to cycled flow ({TSTo}) and a portion due to flow straight through the system (straight throughflow, {TSTs}). The portion of Ā{PL} due to cycled flow divided by the portion due to straight throughflow is the cycling index ({CI}). This index indicates how many times further than the straight throughflow path length an average system inflow will travel because of cycling. Three simple ecosystem models are examined to demonstrate the utility of these measures in explaining ecological phenomena.},

It represents an overall measure of the complexity of a given ecological network, thus allowing for the intercomparison among ecosystems and for assessing their development stage and maturity. Number of links in the web, magnitude of flows and predation on nonadjacent trophic levels, are all influencing the system omnivory index.

	abstract = {Much can be learned about the differences in how two distinct ecosystems are functioning by studying their respective quantitative networks of trophic exchanges. The feeding processes occurring in the ecosystems of the Baltic Sea and the Chesapeake Bay have been parsed into similar 17-node networks of carbon flows, and the use of network analysis to compare the structures reveals that the Baltic ecosystem functions less as a hypertrophic system than does the community in the Chesapeake: The diversity of trophic connections is higher in the Baltic community and the specificity of feeding (trophic articulation) is greater there as well. More pathways for recycle are evident in the Baltic system, and they involve a larger proportion of higher species. Trophic efficiencies are generally greater in the Baltic than they are in the Chesapeake. On a relative basis, about four times as much carbon fixed in primary productivity reaches the fishes of the Baltic than is transferred up the trophic web of the Chesapeake. This disparity is explained in part by a large indirect subsidy that Chesapeake fishes receive from inputs of allochthonous carbon that is processed for them by the benthic community of deposit feeders.},

	abstract = {Descriptions of food-web relationships first appeared more than a century ago, and the quantitative analysis of the network structure of food webs dates back several decades. Recent improvements in food-web data collection and analysis methods, coupled with a resurgence of interdisciplinary research on the topology of many kinds of “real-world” networks, have resulted in renewed interest in food-web structure. This
chapter reviews the history of the search for generalities in the structure of complex food webs, and discusses current and future research trends. Analysis of food-web structure has used empirical and modeling
approaches, and has been inspired both by questions from ecology such as “What factors promote stability of complex ecosystems given internal dynamics and external perturbations? and questions from network research such as “Do food webs display universal structure similar to other types of networks?” Recent research has suggested that once variable diversity and connectance are taken into account, there are universal coarse-grained characteristics of how trophic links and species defined according to trophic function are distributed within food webs. In addition, aspects of food-web network structure have been shown to
strongly influence the robust functioning and dynamical persistence of ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Modern fisheries research and management must understand and take account of the interactions between climate and fishing, rather than try to disentangle their effects and address each separately. These interactions are significant drivers of change in exploited marine systems and have ramifications for ecosystems and those who depend on the services they provide. We discuss how fishing and climate forcing interact on individual fish, marine populations, marine communities, and ecosystems to bring these levels into states that are more sensitive to (i.e. more strongly related with) climate forcing. Fishing is unlikely to alter the sensitivities of individual finfish and invertebrates to climate forcing. It will remove individuals with specific characteristics from the gene pool, thereby affecting structure and function at higher levels of organisation. Fishing leads to a loss of older age classes, spatial contraction, loss of sub-units, and alteration of life history traits in populations, making them more sensitive to climate variability at interannual to interdecadal scales. Fishing reduces the mean size of individuals and mean trophic level of communities, decreasing their turnover time leading them to track environmental variability more closely. Marine ecosystems under intense exploitation evolve towards stronger bottom–up control and greater sensitivity to climate forcing. Because climate change occurs slowly, its effects are not likely to have immediate impacts on marine systems but will be manifest as the accumulation of the interactions between fishing and climate variability — unless threshold limits are exceeded. Marine resource managers need to develop approaches which maintain the resilience of individuals, populations, communities and ecosystems to the combined and interacting effects of climate and fishing. Overall, a less-heavily fished marine system, and one which shifts the focus from individual species to functional groups and fish communities, is likely to provide more stable catches with climate variability and change than would a heavily fished system.},

	abstract = {Kelp beds are one of the most productive marine systems and, while little of this production is directly consumed, there is growing evidence that kelp detritus is an essential food source for many detrital and suspension feeders, and forms an important component of offshore sedimentary carbon pools. However, the extent of the contribution of kelp detritus to the nutrition of coastal fauna is not well resolved. In this study, we compare the contribution of phytoplankton, kelp detritus, and waste from fish cages to the diet of a sentinel suspension feeder, the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) using stable isotopes. We found a significant depletion in both 13C and 15N in kelp tissue with age (distance from stipe to the deteriorating distal end of the kelp frond) which may have biased dietary estimates in previous studies which have applied isotopic source values derived from fresh kelp. Our mixing models indicate that macroalgal detritus formed 59\% of the diet of the mussels in Berehaven, Bantry Bay, Ireland. We support the isotopic mixing model results by modelling the relative production of phytoplankton, kelp, and salmon farm waste, and found the supply of C and N from kelp and phytoplankton far exceeded the requirements of the mussels with much less coming from the nearby fish cages. Monthly chlorophyll measurements indicated there was only sufficient phytoplankton density to support mussel growth during the spring and autumn, explaining our observation of patterns in the relative importance of utilization of kelp detritus. Where there is pressure to harvest kelp beds, this study highlights the supporting ecosystem service they provide as an important dietary source in coastal food webs and emphasises the need for appropriate management measures for this resource.},

	abstract = {Sanggou Bay is well known as an exemplary coastal water of Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture ({IMTA}). {IMTA} as practiced in China is highly ecologically efficient, through the combination of extractive and fed species. In this paper, Ecopath model was used to study the food web structure and function of Sanggou Bay ecosystem. According to the model, Sanggou Bay ecosystem ranged from 1.00–3.89 in trophic level. Sanggou Bay ecosystem was dominated by low trophic levels, of which aggregated trophic level I and {II} ({TL} I and {TL} {II}). {TL} I and {TL} {II} contributed 83.64 \% and 16.36 \% in biomass. Aquaculture species (kelp, oyster, scallop and abalone) were all in {TL} I and {TL} {II}, together accounted for 97.30 \% in biomass of all functional groups. Kelp accounted for 81.12 \% of the total biomass. Transfer efficiency of the ecosystem was 10.85 \%. Aquaculture harvest had a positive influence on scallop, oyster and kelp, but had a negative influence on abalone. All functional groups in Sanggou Bay ecosystem had negative self-impacts, that could be interpreted as intraspecific competition for resources. Oyster, scallop and abalone showed negative impacts on each other. From the system properties, connectance index ({CI}) was 0.26 and system omnivory index ({SOI}) was 0.08, these suggested that Sanggou Bay was influenced by human activities. The ratio of production to respiration (P/R) was 3.57, the ecosystem production is much more than respiration. This presented that {IMTA} in Sanggou Bay showed a way to minimize the disturbance of aquaculture to protect the ecosystem and improve economic benefits for stakeholders.

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            
              Introduction
              : China is responsible for more than 60\% of global aquaculture production. As the frontiers of food production have expanded, the cultivation of marine organisms in coastal zones and the open ocean has grown rapidly. The dominant mariculture industry in China is suspended mariculture, which uses net cages, ropes, or other structures suspended in the water column to cultivate aquatic organisms. This systematic, quantitative review provides a clear and comprehensive account of research that has investigated the adverse impacts of suspended mariculture in China and reviews research that has applied Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture ({IMTA}) systems for mitigating impacts. This work builds on 218 peer reviewed papers that have been published in English-language journals.
            
            
              Outcomes
              : Eighteen impacts were identified, including chemical, ecological, physical, and socioeconomic impacts. Eighteen measures for improving suspended mariculture were recommended consisting of government department, farm management, and ecological engineering measures. {IMTA} was the most frequently recommended measure. The capabilities of {IMTA} for bioremediation and increased farm production were the most frequently studied advantages. Seven other benefits have been explored but remain understudied. The current challenges facing the expansion of commercial {IMTA} include limited use of new technology, limited skills development, decreasing production of low trophic-level species, biogeographic and temporal barriers, and negative system feedbacks.
            
            
              Conclusion
              : Despite challenges, implementing commercial {IMTA} is a promising measure for reducing the impacts of suspended mariculture because it presents a range of secondary benefits that can improve the overall sustainability of aquaculture in the coastal zone.},

	abstract = {The analysis of networks of ecological trophic transfers is a useful complement to simulation modeling in the quest for understanding whole-ecosystem dynamics. Trophic networks can be studied in quantitative and systematic fashion at several levels. Indirect relationships between any two individual taxa in an ecosystem, which often differ in either nature or magnitude from their direct influences, can be assayed using techniques from linear algebra. The same mathematics can also be employed to ascertain where along the trophic continuum any individual taxon is operating, or to map the web of connections into a virtual linear chain that summarizes trophodynamic performance by the system. Backtracking algorithms with pruning have been written which identify pathways for the recycle of materials and energy within the system. The pattern of such cycling often reveals modes of control or types of functions exhibited by various groups of taxa. The performance of the system as a whole at processing material and energy can be quantified using information theory. In particular, the complexity of process interactions can be parsed into separate terms that distinguish organized, efficient performance from the capacity for further development and recovery from disturbance. Finally, the sensitivities of the information-theoretic system indices appear to identify the dynamical bottlenecks in ecosystem functioning.},

Ecosystem models of the western and central Aleutian Islands and Southeast Alaska were used to examine indices of ecosystem status generated from network analysis and incorporated into Ecopath with Ecosim. Dynamic simulations of the two ecosystems over the past 40 years were employed to examine if these indices reflect the dissimilar changes that occurred in the ecosystems. The results showed that the total systems throughput ({TST}) and ascendancy (A) followed the climate change signature (Pacific decadal oscillation, {PDO}) in both ecosystems, whereas the redundancy (R) followed the inverse trend. The different trajectories for important species such as Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), pollock (Theragra chalcograma), herring (Clupea pallasii), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) were noticeable in the Finn cycling index ({FCI}), entropy (H) and average mutual information ({AMI}): not showing large change during the time that the Stellers sea lions, herring, Pacific cod, halibut and arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias) increased in Southeast Alaska, but showing large declines during the decline of Steller sea lions, sharks, Atka mackerel and arrowtooth flounder in the Aleutians. On the whole, there was a change in the emergent properties of the Aleutians around 1976 that was not seen in Southeast Alaska. Conversely, the emergent properties of both systems showed a change around 1988, which indicated that both systems were unstable after 1988.},

	abstract = {Kelp forests are phyletically diverse, structurally complex and highly productive components of coldwater rocky marine coastlines. This paper reviews the conditions in which kelp forests develop globally and where, why and at what rate they become deforested. The ecology and long archaeological history of kelp forests are examined through case studies from southern California, the Aleutian Islands and the western North Atlantic, well-studied locations that represent the widest possible range in kelp forest biodiversity. Global distribution of kelp forests is physiologically constrained by light at high latitudes and by nutrients, warm temperatures and other macrophytes at low latitudes. Within mid-latitude belts (roughly 40–60° latitude in both hemispheres) well-developed kelp forests are most threatened by herbivory, usually from sea urchins. Overfishing and extirpation of highly valued vertebrate apex predators often triggered herbivore population increases, leading to widespread kelp deforestation. Such deforestations have the most profound and lasting impacts on species-depauperate systems, such as those in Alaska and the western North Atlantic. Globally urchin-induced deforestation has been increasing over the past 2–3 decades. Continued fishing down of coastal food webs has resulted in shifting harvesting targets from apex predators to their invertebrate prey, including kelp-grazing herbivores. The recent global expansion of sea urchin harvesting has led to the widespread extirpation of this herbivore, and kelp forests have returned in some locations but, for the first time, these forests are devoid of vertebrate apex predators. In the western North Atlantic, large predatory crabs have recently filled this void and they have become the new apex predator in this system. Similar shifts from fish- to crab-dominance may have occurred in coastal zones of the United Kingdom and Japan, where large predatory finfish were extirpated long ago. Three North American case studies of kelp forests were examined to determine their long history with humans and project the status of future kelp forests to the year 2025. Fishing impacts on kelp forest systems have been both profound and much longer in duration than previously thought. Archaeological data suggest that coastal peoples exploited kelp forest organisms for thousands of years, occasionally resulting in localized losses of apex predators, outbreaks of sea urchin populations and probably small-scale deforestation. Over the past two centuries, commercial exploitation for export led to the extirpation of sea urchin predators, such as the sea otter in the North Pacific and predatory fishes like the cod in the North Atlantic. The large-scale removal of predators for export markets increased sea urchin abundances and promoted the decline of kelp forests over vast areas. Despite southern California having one of the longest known associations with coastal kelp forests, widespread deforestation is rare. It is possible that functional redundancies among predators and herbivores make this most diverse system most stable. Such biodiverse kelp forests may also resist invasion from non-native species. In the species-depauperate western North Atlantic, introduced algal competitors carpet the benthos and threaten future kelp dominance. There, other non-native herbivores and predators have become established and dominant components of this system. Climate changes have had measurable impacts on kelp forest ecosystems and efforts to control the emission of greenhouse gasses should be a global priority. However, overfishing appears to be the greatest manageable threat to kelp forest ecosystems over the 2025 time horizon. Management should focus on minimizing fishing impacts and restoring populations of functionally important species in these systems.},

	abstract = {Risks to the Tasmanian Abalone Fishery from further expansion of the Salmonid Industry September 2014 Please note that this is a preliminary document that sets forth the general position of the Tasmanian Abalone Council Ltd ({TACL}) with regard to the risks associated with further expansion of the salmonid farming industry. This initial submission will be updated and extended with further detail pending the supply of more information from a range of sources. Executive Summary Tasmania’s wild harvest Abalone industry has been generating wealth and creating jobs in Tasmania for over half a century and will continue to do so forever provided the fishery is harvested sustainably and the inshore marine habitat where abalone thrive remains pristine. Valuable export revenue generated by the abalone industry (\$100 million per annum) generates some \$300 million of associated economic activity (via economic multipliers) into the state’s economy and employs over 800 Tasmanians in regional and coastal communities around Tasmania. (http://tasabalone.com.au/about\%20the\%20industry/) The total capitalised value of the industry exceeds \$750 million taking into account the value of abalone quota plus fishing, processing and exporting infrastructure. The industry’s peak body, the Tasmanian Abalone Council Ltd ({TACL}), has recently engaged in a series of meetings with Tasmania’s two largest salmonid producers - Tassal Group Ltd (Tassal) and Huon Aquaculture P/L ({HAC}). These meetings have been prompted by the publicly stated intention of both companies to double the size of the salmonid industry by 2030 and to expand their activities out to inshore oceanic waters. This is a deviation from past practises where salmon cages have been located within sheltered estuarine harbours, channels and embayments. Tassal Ltd has recently confirmed its intention to apply for expanded salmonid lease sites between Dover and Southport in the lower D’Entrecasteaux channel – cage systems at these sites will contain 1.7 million salmon when fully stocked. These sites are adjacent to productive abalone and rock lobster habitat. Huon Aquaculture P/L ({HAC}) has recently confirmed its intention to apply for four lease sites offshore from North Bruny Island near Cape Queen Elizabeth. {HAC} have stated on their website that they hope to be able to farm the amended lease sites of North Bruny from early 2015 – cage systems at these sites will contain up to 4 million salmon when fully stocked. These sites are adjacent to productive abalone and rock lobster habitat.},

	abstract = {Over the last 3 decades fish cage aquaculture has increased exponentially in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and has induced various levels of environmental change in coastal waters. The most apparent negative changes involve the degradation of the native seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile. Our study examined the effects of fish cage aquaculture on seagrass health, sea urchin density and herbivore feeding pressure in shallow seagrass patches in the coastal waters of 2 Greek islands (Evia and Crete) between February and May of 2008. Evia and Crete represent a wide range of fish farming intensities, from small-scale (75 t yr -1) to large-scale (1000 t yr -1) fish production, respectively. On both islands, the seagrass variables, shoot productivity, standing crop and leaf morphometrics (length and width) were significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.0001) in impacted seagrass patches adjacent to fish farms compared with control patches. In addition, significantly higher sea urchin densities and herbivore feeding pressure (percentage of shoots with herbivore grazing scars) were found in impacted patches on both islands. Higher leaf tissue nitrogen and epiphyte loads were also found in impacted patches, but these increases could not be attributed to fish farming alone. Our results show that negative effects on seagrass patches can occur as a result of fish farming at both small-scale and large-scale intensities and that increased sea urchin densities and feeding pressures are important indirect effects of coastal aquaculture on these islands. © Inter-Research 2012.},

	abstract = {Pests and diseases of eucheumatoid farming were studied in Lian Bay, Hainan Province, China, from March 2009 to December 2013. Neosiphonia savatieri, ice-ice disease, and the herbivorous fish Siganus fuscescens were found to be the dominant pests and disease. Infections of N. savatieri increased severely in May 2009 and especially so in August 2009. Then, they remained severe the whole year round, until all the Kappaphycus spp. in the bay was wiped out by October 2010. The outbreak pattern of ice-ice disease was the same as that for N. savatieri. Based on our results, the period mostly from May to August and also into October was the period of frequent outbreak of the epiphyte and ice-ice disease at this Kappaphycus spp. farm. Different from the Kappaphycus spp., Eucheuma denticulatum showed more resistance to N. savatieri and ice-ice disease at the same time and location. A reduced occurrence of N. savatieri and ice-ice disease infections in Kappaphycus spp. was observed when Kappaphycus spp. were co-cultured with E. denticulatum during July-August but not during September-October. The fish S. fuscescens swarmed into the bay from the outside sea from April to May, when the seawater temperature increased to above 26 A degrees C. Interestingly, the S. fuscescens usually prefer N. savatieri to Kappaphycus alvarezii, and they grazed on K. alvarezii only after the amount of N. savatieri became insufficient to meet their needs. From these observations, we suggest managing the S. fuscescens with different nets at different seasons but not bombs and poison.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing demand for environmental assessments of the marine environment to include ecosystem function. However, existing schemes are predominantly based on taxonomic (i.e. structural) measures of biodiversity. Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function ({BEF}) relationships are suggested to provide a mechanism for converting taxonomic information into surrogates of ecosystem function. This review assesses the evidence for marine {BEF} relationships and their potential to be used in practical monitoring applications (i.e. operationalized). Five key requirements were identified for the practical application of {BEF} relationships: (1) a complete understanding of strength, direction and prevalence ofmarine {BEF} relationships, (2) an understanding of which biological components are influential within specific {BEF} relationships, (3) the biodiversity of the selected biological components can be measured easily, (4) the ecological mechanisms that are the most important for generating marine {BEF} relationships, i.e. identity effects or complementarity, are known and (5) the proportion of the overall functional variance is explained by biodiversity, and hence {BEF} relationships, has been established. Numerous positive and some negative {BEF} relationships were found within the literature, although many reproduced poorly the natural species richness, trophic structures or multiple functions of real ecosystems (requirement 1). Null relationships were also reported. The consistency of the positive and negative relationships was often low that compromised the ability to generalize {BEF} relationships and confident application of {BEF} within marine monitoring. Equally, some biological components and functions have received little or no investigation. Expert judgement was used to attribute biological components using spatial extent, presence and functional rate criteria (requirement 2). This approach highlighted the main biological components contributing the most to specific ecosystem functions, and that many of the particularly influential components were found to have received the least amount of research attention. The need for biodiversity to be measureable (requirement 3) is possible for most biological compo- nents although difficult within the functionally important microbes. Identity effects underpinned most marine {BEF} relationships (requirement 4). As such, processes that translated structural biodiversity measures into functional diversity were found to generate better {BEF} relationships.},

Samples were collected using experimental trawling, before the establishment of fish cages in the area during early June 1987 and after attaining the maximal production of the aquaculture zone in late May 2001. The overall abundance of the fish assemblage increased by a factor of 4 and the average trophic level of the fish community increased from 3.59 to 3.79. Traditional diversity indices showed an increase in dominance but the distinctness measures of biodiversity showed that the overall structure obtained after the establishment of fish farming was not phylogenetically impoverished. Multivariate analysis showed that the community differences between the two periods are quantitative rather than qualitative. Comparisons in length frequencies between the two periods indicated that specimens of the species compared were either similar or larger in the second period. The species favoured by the presence of aquaculture were not the ones normally feeding on the food pellets under the cages but those normally occurring in the fishing grounds of the study. It is concluded that the release of nutrients from fish farming in nutrient-poor systems can have a positive effect on local fisheries with no visible negative change in species composition or biodiversity. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The hypothesis that the presence of fish farms affects the communities of wild fish at large spatial scales was investigated through experimental trawl surveys. Three regions of the Aegean Sea with aquaculture zones were sampled in May and September (reproductive and recruitment periods, respectively for most species in the Aegean Sea). In each region, 2 sub-areas were sampled: 1 located nearby the fish farming zones (within 2 to 3 n mile) and a similar site ('reference site') far away from these zones ({\textgreater}20 n mile). Three replicate hauls were made in each sub-area for each of the 3 investigated regions. Significant differences were observed in community structure between farming and reference sites, which were mainly due to quantitative rather than qualitative aspects. The overall abundance and/or biomass of wild demersal fish was significantly higher near the fish farms in every region studied during May without any significant change in diversity or biodiversity. During the recruitment period in September, total abundance and biomass were fairly similar. These findings support the hypothesis that the presence of fish farms affects the wild fish populations in the oligotrophic eastern Mediterranean at a spatial scale larger than the immediate vicinity of fish cages. It seems that during the recruitment period all sites were stocked with fish close to the carrying capacity of the respective areas, and by late spring the areas close to fish farming zones had suffered little losses during winter, whereas populations at the reference sites had decreased substantially. © Inter-Research 2005.},

	abstract = {A mass-balance trophic model was built to describe the food-web traits of the North Aegean Sea (Strymonikos Gulf and Thracian Sea, Greece, Eastern Mediterranean) during the mid-2000s and to explore the impacts of fishing. This is the first food-web model representing the Aegean Sea, and results were presented and discussed in comparison to other previous ecosystems modelled from the western and the central areas of the basin (South Catalan and North-Central Adriatic Seas). Forty functional groups were defined, covering the entire trophic spectrum from lower to higher trophic levels. Emphasis was placed on commercial invertebrates and fish. The potential ecological role of the invasive ctenophore, Mnemiopsis leidyi, and several vulnerable groups (e.g., dolphins) was also explored. Results confirmed the spatial productivity patterns known for the Mediterranean Sea showing, for example, that the total biomass is highest in N.C. Adriatic and lowest in N. Aegean Sea. Accordingly, food-web flows and several ecosystem indicators like the mean transfer efficiency were influenced by these patterns. Nevertheless, all three systems shared some common features evidencing similarities of Mediterranean Sea ecosystems such as dominance of the pelagic fraction in terms of flows and strong benthic-pelagic coupling of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates through detritus. The importance of detritus highlighted the role of the microbial food-web, which was indirectly considered through detritus dynamics. Ciliates, mesozooplankton and several benthic invertebrate groups were shown as important elements of the ecosystem linking primary producers and detritus with higher trophic levels in the N. Aegean Sea. Adult anchovy was shown as the most important fish group in terms of production, consumption and overall effect on the rest of the ecological groups in the model, in line with results from the Western Mediterranean Sea. The five fishing fleets considered (both artisanal and industrial) had high impacts on vulnerable species and numerous targeted groups given the multispecies nature of the fisheries in the N. Aegean Sea. Several exploitation indices highlighted that the N. Aegean Sea ecosystem was highly exploited and unlikely to be sustainably fished, similarly to other Mediterranean marine ecosystems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This dataset includes Continuous Plankton Recorder ({CPR}) data, as part of the Australian Plankton Survey ({AusCPR}). The dataset comprises zooplankton abundance and biomass index. The biomass index is the dried mass of the plankton washed off the silk and dried in an oven at 60oC for 24 hours. This, therefore, represent the total plankton biomass.

To understand how {CPR} plankton data is analysed and how to use {CPR} data we recommend reading Richardson et al., 2006.

The data are made available in binned products for ease of use. As taxonomy changes over time and the ability of analysts improves with training more and more species can be identified over time. The products account for these changes and for real absences from the samples. A 0 abundance means that the species was looked for and not seen, null (empty cell) means that the species was not looked for in that sample. The products are therefore applicable for use in time series analysis.

There are a total of 6 products to choose from.
Zooplankton abundance products are available at 5 levels:
Raw product (includes all data)
Copepods product (all data where species have been identified, Copepods only)
Non-Copepods product (all data where species have been identified, non-Copepods only)
Genus product (includes all data binned to genus level)
Higher taxonomic group (includes all data binned to functional groups).
(each of these products includes the biomass index per samples)
Plus
Derived indices (useful indices at segment level for {CPR} data)

Plankton abundances were originally provided on the {AODN} Portal only as raw data, in flat table form (with each species recorded in a separate row), without any adjustments for taxonomy changes or real absences.
The first version of the "analysis-ready" products were first published on 21/12/2018. However, they were removed again in April 2021 because technical issues prevented them from being regularly updated.},

	abstract = {The widespread call for a transition toward “ecosystem-based” ﬁsheries management implies the development and testing of sustainability indicators suitable for inferences on the status of the ecosystems within which ﬁsheries resource species are embedded. The mean trophic level ({TL}) of ﬁsheries catches has been shown to allow for such inferences, leading in the process to the identiﬁcation of global trends toward catches being increasingly dominated by low-{TL} species, a process now known as “ﬁshing down marine food webs.” However, for inferences from {TL} trends to be accurate, taxonomic and especially geographic over-aggregation of the underlying catch data must be avoided. Accounting for these strong sources of bias suggests that the ﬁshing down eﬀect is far more pervasive than previously thought, and in fact occurs in areas where initial analyses failed to detect it. This conﬁrms the common verdict of absent sustainability for most ﬁsheries of the world. This is illustrated here by ﬁve brief case studies, of which three also document a new method for estimating ecosystem transfer eﬃciency, under a set of speciﬁc conditions, from time series of catches and their corresponding mean {TL}.

	title = {Ecopath with Ecosim version 6: User Guide},
	url = {https://www.ecopath.org},
	abstract = {Ecopath with Ecosim is designed for straightforward construction, parameterization and analysis of mass-balance trophic models of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Focus is on using the models for fisheries management, and a suite of tools are included for this aim. This help system describes how to obtain, install and use the Ecopath software system written for personal computers using the Windows environment. Brief accounts are given of the theory behind the models developed using Ecopath with Ecosim. The Ecopath mass-balance modeling system is built on an approach initially presented by J.J. Polovina for estimating biomass and food consumption of the elements (species or groups of species) of an aquatic ecosystem. Subsequently it was combined with various approaches from theoretical ecology, notably those proposed by R.E. Ulanowicz, for the analysis of flows between the elements of ecosystems. However, the system has been optimized for direct use in fisheries assessment as well as for addressing environmental questions through the inclusion of the temporal dynamic model, Ecosim, and the spatial dynamic model, Ecospace. Since its initial development in the early 1980s, the mass-balance approach incorporated in the Ecopath software has been widely used for constructing food web models of marine and other ecosystems. This has led to a number of generalizations on the structure and functioning of such ecosystems, relevant to the issue of fisheries impacts. Some of these generalizations have revisited older themes, while others were new. Both sets of generalizations have impacted on the development of the Ecopath approach itself. Herein, the description of the average state of an ecosystem, using Ecopath proper, also serves to parameterize systems of coupled difference and differential equations, used to depict changes in biomasses and trophic interactions in time (Ecosim) and space (Ecospace). The results of these simulations can then be used to modify the initial Ecopath parameterization, and the simulations rerun until external validation is achieved. This reconceptualization of the Ecopath approach as an iterative process, which helps address issues of structural uncertainty, does not, however, markedly increase its input requirements. Rather, it has become possible, through a semi-Bayesian resampling routine to explicitly consider the numerical uncertainty associated with these inputs. Real ecosystems are more complicated than the mass-balance fluxes of biomass in Ecopath, however large the number of functional groups we include in our models. Real ecosystems also have dynamics far more complex than represented in Ecosim. The issue to consider, when evaluating the realism of simulation software, is, however, not how complex the software and the processes are that are represented therein. Rather, the question is which structure allows a representation of the basic features of an ecosystem, given a limited amount of inputs. On such criterion, it was obvious that a major deficiency of the Ecopath with Ecosim approach was its assumption of homogenous spatial behavior. This has been remedied through the development of Ecospace (Note that in Walters et al., 1999 Equation 13, the sign for the T' factor was reversed by mistake.), a dynamic, spatial version of Ecopath, incorporating all key elements of Ecosim (incl. different vulnerabilities and split pools, see above). The Ecopath with Ecosim software had by 2003 been distributed to more than 2500 registered users in 124 countries, and more than 200 publications utilizing it have appeared in the scientific literature.

	title = {Marine Growth and the Hydrodynamic Loading of Offshore Structures},
	abstract = {This thesis presents the results of a study on the effects of marine growth on the hydrodynamic loading of offshore structures and proposes an approach that can be adopted by designers and operators to quantify these effects. The approach is based upon the realistic characterisation of marine growth and its temporal variations during the life span of template structures.

Past research work and current design, inspection and maintenance practices are critically reviewed and their limitations with respect to marine growth are highlighted. The ecology of marine growth for a sample of North Sea platforms was examined to establish the variety and physical attributes of the fouling colonies. The traditional single-parameter characterisation of marine roughness was found to be inadequate. Appropriate parameters, verified by fluid loading experiments, are established.

Details of the laboratory experiments undertaken with both real marine growth and artificial macro-roughness on circular cylinders are given. These tests were carried out at large scale (cylinders up to 521mm diameter) in a novel "buoyant cylinder" test rig (steady flow) and in a large wave flume (regular waves). A wide range of parametric variations were undertaken for the various types of marine growth in an attempt to establish a comprehensive database from which the loading effect of any likely, practically occurring, marine growth pattern can be estimated. The extent to which this is achieved and the requirements for further research are discussed in detail.

It is concluded that the effects of marine growth are both substantial and diverse. Drag forces vary with type of fouling, overall thickness, surface cover, and distribution. Finally, detailed procedures are recommended for the design of new structures and the improved loading assessment of existing ones.},

The test program comprised: (a) cylinders with different distributions of marine growth (mussels and kelp) and artificial roughness at low surface cover; (b) fully sand/gravel-roughened cylinders with aspect ratios (L/D) from 3.75 to 10 and relative roughness (k/D) up to 0.025; (c) cylinders covered in regular arrays of pyramids at (k/D) up to 0.1. Based on the results, some tentative conclusions are drawn about the estimation of the effect of marine fouling on the fluid loading of offshore structures.},

In field experiments, the {SGR} ranged from 6.30\%/d to 13.00\%/d, and the average C sequestration rate was 9.25 mg/(g {DW}·h) and 6.68 mg/(g {DW}·h) in the G. lemaneiformis cultivation area (region 1) and fish cage area (region 4), respectively. The {NH}4+-N uptake rate of G. lemaneiformis was the highest in region 1 and region 4 with 56.98 ± 4.81 μg/(g {DW}·h) and 38.68 ± 7.12 μg/(g {DW}·h), respectively. The maximum removal efficiency of {NH}4+-N, {NO}3−-N, {NO}2–N, and {PO}43--P were 45.99–59.79\%, 13.10–30.21\%, 12.88–14.11\%, and 27.07–31.49\% in G. lemaneiformis cultivated areas compared with those in fish cage area. The extrapolated results showed that 1192.03 tonnes of C, 128.10 tonnes of N and 15.89 tonnes of P would be simultaneously sequestered from the seawater through G. lemaneiformis cultivation in Yantian Bay. Results indicated that G. lemaneiformis had high growth rates and nutrient removal efficiencies under different nutrient conditions, which made it a good candidate for seaweed/animals integrated multi-trophic aquaculture in nutrient bioextraction and economic diversification.},

Different water depths and wave parameters (height and period) are considered for both regular and irregular waves with and without an underlying uniform current coming from different directions. The study of the submergence ratio (h/hv) influence shows that wave damping coefficient rapidly decreases as the plant submergence ratio increases. The high nonlinearities found in the wave-current interaction lead to different wave damping patterns in comparison to wave-only conditions. A smaller wave damping is found for waves and current acting in the same direction and an increase in the wave damping rate is obtained for waves and current flowing in the opposite direction. These wave and current tests allow for the studying of the energy dissipation produced by the vegetation, increasing our knowledge about flow and plant interaction in estuarine conditions. The biomechanical properties of the two real salt marshes used in the experiments are also evaluated and related to wave damping revealing a higher attenuation for stiffer vegetation. Both, the vegetation density and the biomass strongly influence wave damping. Higher density and biomass values lead to higher attenuation rates for both species.},

	abstract = {Allelopathy in aquatic environments may provide a competitive advantage to angiosperms, algae, or cyanobacteria in their interaction with other primary producers. Allelopathy can influence the competition between different photoautotrophs for resources and change the succession of species, for example, in phytoplankton communities. Field evidence and laboratory studies indicate that allelopathy occurs in all aquatic habitats (marine and freshwater), and that all primary producing organisms (cyanobacteria, micro- and macroalgae as well as angiosperms) are capable of producing and releasing allelopathically active compounds. Although allelopathy also includes positive (stimulating) interactions, the majority of studies describe the inhibitory activity of allelopathically active compounds. Different mechanisms operate depending on whether allelopathy takes place in the open water (pelagic zone) or is substrate associated (benthic habitats). Allelopathical interactions are especially common in fully aquatic species, such as submersed macrophytes or benthic algae and cyanobacteria. The prevention of shading by epiphytic and planktonic primary producers and the competition for space may be the ultimate cause for allelopathical interactions. Aquatic allelochemicals often target multiple physiological processes. The inhibition of photosynthesis of competing primary producers seems to be a frequent mode of action. Multiple biotic and abiotic factors determine the strength of allelopathic interactions. Bacteria associated with the donor or target organism can metabolize excreted allelochemicals. Frequently, the impact of surplus or limiting nutrients has been shown to affect the overall production of allelochemicals and their effect on target species. Similarities and differences of allelopathic interactions in marine and freshwater habitats as well as between the different types of producing organisms are discussed.},

	abstract = {It is argued that there is circumstantial but strong evidence that allelopathic interference between submerged macrophytes and phytoplankton may indeed exist in aquatic ecosystems despite the problems associated with research in this field. Allelopathy, here defined as biochemical interactions between aquatic primary producers, has always been intriguing as a process explaining the dominance of certain plant or algal species over others. Negative chemical interference has been invoked as one of the steering mechanisms behind mutual dominance of either submerged macrophytes or phytoplankton in shallow eutrophic lakes. Yet, despite much effort, convincing evidence for allelopathic interactions in situ is still missing. Also, laboratory approaches often lack reality. Inspired by a series of talks at the Shallow Lakes 2005 meeting in Dalfsen, the Netherlands, we argue that there is circumstantial but strong evidence that allelopathic interference between submerged macrophytes and phytoplankton may indeed exist in aquatic ecosystems despite the problems associated with research in this field. We first discuss experimental approaches combining laboratory and field studies, based on examples presented at this meeting. We then discuss the impact of nutrient status of both producing and target organism and biotic factors such as herbivory or pathogens that might affect allelopathy. Further topics are the potential seasonality of effects and the species-specificity of certain allelochemicals. We conclude with some thoughts why a final proof for allelopathy in situ might remain difficult or even inaccessible in some cases, and why we nevertheless should not abandon this idea.},

The macroalgae differed in terms of their epiphytic coverage of bacteria, fungi and diatoms. Macroalgae, largely devoid of epiphytic diatoms, were hypothesized to employ effective antifouling means to reduce epiphytic coverage, whilst heavily fouled macroalgae were proposed to lack antifouling strategies. To test these hypotheses from an allelochemical perspective with regard to fouling diatoms, dichloromethane-methanol (1:1) crude extracts of macroalgae were concentrated in dimethylsulfoxide and investigated in diatom attachment and proliferation assays using four benthic diatoms (Nitzschia sp., Navicula phyllepta, Navicula arenaria and Amphora sp.). Algal extracts exhibited a distinct pattern of activity against the test diatoms, suggesting a targeted and selective effect of macroalgal metabolites on individual fouling diatoms. The main outcome of this study was that visual inspection and quantitative categorization of epiphytic colonizers on macroalgal thalli could not be used to predict reliably whether macroalgae employed a chemical defense mechanism.},

A better understanding is needed of their spatial distribution and early life history to disrupt the life cycle of the sea louse. In this study, sea lice larval densities within salmon farms, between salmon farms and reference sites, and at various depths were quantified using both plankton pumps and plankton nets. Farm sites exhibited significantly higher densities than reference sites; however, these densities dropped an order of magnitude at a distance of 100 m from the cages. The majority of the larvae captured in the study were nauplii (93\%), and densities ranged from 0 to 10 larvae/m3. Free-swimming sea lice larvae were found to exhibit a diel cycle where nauplii larvae were in deeper waters (10–17 m) during the day and in surface waters (1–6 m) during the night. The results of this study suggest that the early life-history stages of sea lice originate from and may remain close to active salmon farms, creating a self-sustaining population.},

	abstract = {In this paper vertical structure of tidal current in a typically coastal raft-culture area is discussed by field measurement and a numerical model. The observations show that the vertical structure changed dramatically. A tidal surface boundary layer ({SBL}) is well formed due to the frictional effects induced by extensive, high-density suspended culture as surface obstruction. Both the aquaculture drag and the bottom friction are much higher than those in non-raft-culture areas, and show an obvious variation with tidal flow. The significant earlier ebbing and earlier flooding appear in the upper water column instead of the seabed. And the maximal phase lag is about 1 h within one tide cycle. A 1D hydrodynamic model was modified to include the {SBL} and parameterized with the field data. It replicated the observed velocity profile and was then used to investigate the impacts of varying culture density and bottom friction on the vertical tidal-current structure. Modeling results indicate that the surface current velocity was largely damped because culture activities enhanced the frictional effects on flow intensively. The magnitude and vertical structure of tidal current are determined together with aquaculture drag and bottom friction. In addition, the vertical velocity structure has a nonlinear trend along with culture density and bottom friction. This study is a theoretical foundation for optimizing aquaculture configuration through regulating culture density and species distribution. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here we review issues relating to the design and mechanics of shellfish longline structures in relation to the offshore marine environment. Two main facets are explored: (i) the effect of the flow (waves and currents) on the farm and (ii) the reverse perspective of the impact of the farm on the flow. Because these systems are relatively new, we first examine similar systems, both natural (kelp beds) and man-made (floating breakwaters, fish farms). Techniques for measuring both the local oceanography and the structural response are listed along with new approaches for measuring important properties. A number of future applied research topics are identified as being a key to advancing the industry, including issues like mooring design, vertical drag coefficients, wave-current interaction, stratification and influence on fauna. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {To enable better predictive capability of the impact from large marine cage fish farms on the benthos and improved objectivity in the regulatory decision-making process, a computer particle tracking model {DEPOMOD} was developed. {DEPOMOD} predicts the solids accumulation on the seabed arising from a fish farm and associated changes in the benthic faunal community. The grid generation module allows the user to set up a grid containing information on depth, cage and sampling station positions for the area of interest. Given the information on wastage rates of fish food and faeces and hydrodynamics of the area, the initial deposition of particles on the seabed can then be predicted with the particle tracking model. The resuspension model then redistributes particles according to near-bed current flow fields to predict the net solids accumulated on the seabed within the grid area. From quantitative relationships between benthic community descriptors and solids accumulation, predictions of the level of benthic community impact can then be made. The particle tracking model was validated using sediment trap studies. Model predictions of flux (g/m2/day) generally agreed well with field data with an accuracy of ± 20\% and ± 13\% for a dispersive and depositional site, respectively. Using parameters from the validated resuspension model (rare among models in this field), semi-empirical quantitative relationships between predicted solids accumulation (g/m2/year) and observed Infaunal Trophic Index ({ITI}) and total individual abundance were established using data from numerous Scottish marine fish farms. A submodel was also validated for predicting feed input throughout a growing cycle for planning purposes. {DEPOMOD} may be used for assessing the potential impact of a farm throughout a growing cycle, or if the biomass consent is increased. It may also be used in the site selection process of a new farm to investigate the proposed farm position and biomass levels. Prediction of the dispersion of particulates during use of in-feed medicines may also be undertaken.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional, primitive equation, time-dependent, σ coordinate, free surface, estuarine and coastal ocean circulation model is described in detail. An apparently unique feature is its Imbedded turbulent closure submodel which on the basis of previous studies should yield realistic, Ekman surface and bottom layers. The model has been designed to represent ocean physics as realistically as possible given the present-day state of the art and to address phenomena of 1-100 km length and tidal-monthly time scales depending on basin size and grid resolution. The prognostic variables are the three components of the velocity field, temperature, salinity, and two quantities which characterize the turbulence, the turbulence kinetic energy and the turbulence macroscale. The governing equations together with their boundary conditions are solved by finite difference techniques. A horizontally and vertically staggered lattice of grid points is used for the computations. An implicit numerical scheme in the vertical direction and a mode splitting technique in time have been adopted for computational efficiency. The numerics have been designed to readily accommodate the highly time-dependent and often nonlinear processes of coastal upwelling and eddy dynamics. The numerical model incorporates realistic coastline and bottom topography. The actual computer code is configured to take advantage of the array processing design of modern computers so that long-term integrations are possible at tolerable cost. Applications of the model to a variety of coastal settings all produce circulation predictions which seem quite realistic when compared to the available data/theory. These applications include a simulation of the tides in the Chesapeake Bay, a simulation of the coastal circulation off Long Island, New York, and a computation of the general circulation in the Middle and South Atlantic Bights and in the Gulf of Mexico. The grid spacings have ranged from 1 to 50 km in these applications. In a new application to coastal upwelling, the model's behavior is in accord with recently developed ideas of coastal trapped waves.},

	abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) release by seaweeds (marine macroalgae) is a critical component of the coastal ocean biogeochemical carbon cycle but is an aspect of seaweed carbon physiology that we know relatively little about. Seaweed-derived {DOC} is found throughout coastal ecosystems and supports multiple food web linkages. Here, we discuss the mechanisms of {DOC} release by seaweeds and group them into passive (leakage, requires no energy) and active release (exudation, requires energy) with particular focus on the photosynthetic “overflow” hypothesis. The release of {DOC} from seaweeds was first studied in the 1960s, but subsequent studies use a range of units hindering evaluation: we convert published values to a common unit (μmol C · g {DW}−1 · h−1) allowing comparisons between seaweed phyla, functional groups, biogeographic region, and an assessment of the environmental regulation of {DOC} production. The range of {DOC} release rates by seaweeds from each phylum under ambient environmental conditions was 0–266.44 μmol C · g {DW}−1 · h−1 (Chlorophyta), 0–89.92 μmol C · g {DW}−1 · h−1 (Ochrophyta), and 0–41.28 μmol C · g {DW}−1· h−1 (Rhodophyta). {DOC} release rates increased under environmental factors such as desiccation, high irradiance, non-optimal temperatures, altered salinity, and elevated dissolved carbon dioxide ({CO}2) concentrations. Importantly, {DOC} release was highest by seaweeds that were desiccated ({\textless}90 times greater {DOC} release compared to ambient). We discuss the impact of future ocean scenarios (ocean acidification, seawater warming, altered irradiance) on {DOC} release rates by seaweeds, the role of seaweed-derived {DOC} in carbon sequestration models, and how they inform future research directions.},

	abstract = {Macroalgal communities in Australia and around the world store vast quantities of carbon in their living biomass, but their prevalence of growing on hard substrata means that they have limited capacity to act as long-term carbon sinks. Unlike other coastal blue carbon habitats such as seagrasses, saltmarshes and mangroves, they do not develop their own organic-rich sediments, but may instead act as a rich carbon source and make significant contributions in the form of detritus to sedimentary habitats by acting as a "carbon donor" to "receiver sites" where organic material accumulates. The potential for storage of this donated carbon however, is dependent on the decay rate during transport and the burial efficiency at receiver sites. To better understand the potential contribution of macroalgal communities to coastal blue carbon budgets, a comprehensive literature search was conducted using key words, including carbon sequestration, macroalgal distribution, abundance and productivity to provide an estimation of the total amount of carbon stored in temperate Australian macroalgae. Our most conservative calculations estimate 109.9TgC is stored in living macroalgal biomass of temperate Australia, using a coastal area covering 249,697km2. Estimates derived for tropical and subtropical regions contributed an additional 23.2TgC. By extending the search to include global studies we provide a broader context and rationale for the study, contributing to the global aspects of the review. In addition, we discuss the potential role of calcium carbonate-containing macroalgae, consider the dynamic nature of macroalgal populations in the context of climate change, and identify the knowledge gaps that once addressed will enable robust quantification of macroalgae in marine biogeochemical cycling of carbon. We conclude that macroalgal communities have the potential to make ecologically meaningful contributions toward global blue carbon sequestration, as donors, but given that the fate of detached macroalgal biomass remains unclear, further research is needed to quantify this contribution.},

The paper presents a holistic qualitative assessment of ecosystem services affected by seaweed cultivation on the Swedish west coast. Results suggest that supporting, regulating and provisioning services are mainly positively or non-affected while some of the cultural services are likely negatively affected. The analysis opens for a discussion on the framing of seaweed cultivation - is it a way of supplying ecosystem services and/or a way of generating valuable biomass? Exploring these framings further in local contexts may be valuable for identifying trade-offs and designing appropriate policies and development strategies. Many of the found impacts are likely generalizable in their character across sites and scales of cultivation, but for some services, including most of the supporting services, the character of impacts is likely to be site-specific and not generalizable.},

	abstract = {Trophic interactions can result in changes to the abundance and distribution of habitat-forming species that dramatically reduce ecosystem functioning. In the coastal zone of the Aleutian Archipelago, overgrazing by herbivorous sea urchins that began in the 1990s resulted in widespread deforestation of the region’s kelp forests, which led to lower macroalgal abundances and higher benthic irradiances. We examined how this deforestation impacted ecosystem function by comparing patterns of net ecosystem production ({NEP}), gross primary production ({GPP}), ecosystem respiration (Re), and the range between {GPP} and Re in remnant kelp forests, urchin barrens, and habitats that were in transition between the two habitat types at nine islands that spanned more than 1000 kilometers of the archipelago. Our results show that deforestation, on average, resulted in a 24\% reduction in {GPP}, a 26\% reduction in Re, and a 24\% reduction in the range between {GPP} and Re. Further, the transition habitats were intermediate to the kelp forests and urchin barrens for these metrics. These opposing metabolic processes remained in balance; however, which resulted in little-to-no changes to {NEP}. These effects of deforestation on ecosystem productivity, however, were highly variable between years and among the study islands. In light of the worldwide declines in kelp forests observed in recent decades, our findings suggest that marine deforestation profoundly affects how coastal ecosystems function.},

	abstract = {The aquaculture sector is anticipated to be a keystone in food production systems in the coming decades. However, it is associated with potentially important environmental damages caused by its contribution to eutrophication or climate change, for example. To comprehensively quantify those impacts, life cycle assessment ({LCA}) studies have been conducted on several seafood farming systems for the past 15 years. But, what major findings and common trends can we draw from this pool of studies? What can we learn to provide recommendations to decision and policymakers in the aquaculture sector? To address these questions, we performed a critical review of 65 {LCA} studies of aquaculture systems from the open literature. We conducted quantitative analyses to explore which impacts can be identified as dominating and to compare different types of aquaculture systems. Our results evidenced that the feed production is a key driver for climate change, acidification, cumulative energy use and net primary production use, while the farming process is a key driver for eutrophication. We also found that different aquaculture systems and technology components may exert considerably different environmental impacts. Based on identified patterns and comparisons, we therefore provided specific recommendations to aquaculture stakeholders for future policy and system development. Overall, the analysis of existing studies demonstrates that important insights can be gained by applying {LCA} to aquaculture systems, and, to move towards an environmentally sustainable aquaculture sector, we recommend its systematic use in the design of new aquaculture systems or policies, and/or in the evaluation and optimization of existing ones.},

To determine reserve site configurations that provide highest persistence values with respect to their connectivity characteristics, we model nine connectivity topological models derived from graph theory in a demographic metapopulation model. We identify reserve site configurations that provide the highest persistence values for each of the metapopulation connectivity models. Except for the minimally connected and fully connected populations, we observed two general ‘rules of thumb’ for optimising the mean life time for all topological models: firstly place the majority of reserves, so that they are neighbours of each other, on the sites where the number of connections between the populations is highest (hub), secondly when the reserves have occupied the majority of the vertices in the hub, then select another area of high connectivity and repeat. If there are no suitable hubs remaining then distribute the remaining reserves to isolated locations optimising contact with non-reserved sites.},

employed differential equations which originated in classical mechanics. Quantitative ecological dynamics were initially described
in a formal analogy to physical processes. In the last few decades, the methodological repertoire in ecological modelling
was successively expanded. Nowadays, the whole range of quantitative methods available in numerical mathematics can be seen
as a foundation for future model development in ecology. Some pioneers in the field are briefly introduced and their contributions
linked to some of the mainstreams and sidelines of the state-of-the-art in ecological sciences. The overview provided here

	abstract = {The flow of detritus between habitats is an important form of connectivity that affects regional productivity and the spatial organization of marine ecosystems. Kelps form highly productive beds or forests that produce detritus through incremental blade erosion, fragmentation of blades, and dislodgement of whole fronds and thalli. Rates of detrital production range from 8 to 2657 g C m-2 yr-1 for blade erosion and fragmentation, and from 22 to 839 g C m-2 yr-1 for loss of fronds and thalli. The estimated global average rate of detrital production by kelps is 706 g C m-2 yr-1, accounting for 82\% of annual kelp productivity. Detrital production rates are regulated by current and wave-driven hydrodynamic forces and are highest during severe storms and following blade weakening through damage by grazers and encrusting epibionts. Detritus settles within kelp beds or forests and is exported to neighboring or distant habitats, including sandy beaches, rocky intertidal shores, rocky and sedimentary subtidal areas, and the deep sea. Exported kelp detritus can provide a significant resource subsidy and enhance secondary production in these communities ranging from tens of meters to hundreds of kilometers from the source of production. Loss of kelp biomass is occurring worldwide through the combined effects of climate change, pollution, fishing, and harvesting of kelp, which can depress rates of detrital production and subsidy to adjacent communities, with large-scale consequences for productivity. © Inter-Research 2012.},

	url = {http://doi.org/10.3354/meps10564},
	abstract = {Owing to their productivity, kelps may be the main primary carbon source for consumers in coastal areas. Their contribution has often been compared to that of phytoplankton, but the potential involvement of the red algae associated with kelp forests has been overlooked. All these 3 primary sources have distinct life cycles and may contribute to the particulate organic matter pool differently according to season. In the present study, we characterised the trophic structure of a pristine Laminaria hyperborea forest off the coast of Brittany (France) in terms of the organic carbon biomass of the main primary producers and consumer trophic groups on 4 sampling dates over a 1 yr period. Senescence of many red algae species occurred during their resting period (i.e. before November), whereas the kelp regrowth period (i.e. before March) was accompanied by the fragmentation of old lamina. During these periods, when phytoplankton biomass is comparable, stable isotope analyses (δ13C and ω15N) were conducted in an attempt to link structure to trophic functioning. By combining analyses of temporal variability in primary source and consumer isotopic ratios and using mixing models, we inferred changes in the trophic significance of macroalgae in the associated food web. Decaying kelp laminae were a major contributor to the particulate organic matter pool, and the fragmentation of old lamina promoted their contribution to the diet of deposit- and suspension-feeders in March. Growth of red algae enhanced direct grazer consumption in March, while their senescence contributed significantly to primary consumer diets in November via indirect consumption.© Inter-Research 2013. www.int-res.com.},

	abstract = {Kelp farming is increasing along the temperate coastlines of the Americas and Europe. The economic, ecological, and social frameworks surrounding kelp farming in these new areas are in contrast with the conditions of progenitor kelp farming regions in China, Japan, and Korea. Thus, identifying and addressing the environmental and social impacts of kelp farming in these regions is vital to ensuring the industry's long-term sustainability. Here, a conceptual model of the human and natural systems supporting this nascent kelp aquaculture sector was developed using Maine, {USA} as a focal region. Potential negative impacts of kelp aquaculture were identified to be habitat degradation, overfishing of wild seeds, predation and competition with wild fish and genes, and transmission of diseases. Increased food security, improved restoration efforts, greater fisheries productivity, and alternative livelihoods development were determined to be potential positive impacts of kelp aquaculture. Changes in biodiversity and productivity resulting from either negative or positive impacts of kelp aquaculture were confirmed to have downstream effects on local fisheries and coastal communities. Recommendations to improve or protect the ecosystem services tangential to kelp farming include: define ecosystem and management boundaries, assess ecosystem services and environmental carrying capacity, pursue ecologically and socially considerate engineering, and protect the health and genetic diversity of wild kelp beds. Recommendations to ensure that kelp farming improves the well-being of all stakeholders include: increase horizontal expansion, expand and teach Best Management Practices, and develop climate change resiliency. Additionally, an integrated management strategy should be developed for wild and farmed kelp to ensure that kelp aquaculture is developed in the context of other sectors and goals.},

	abstract = {Kelp cultivation started in Japan, China and Korea, mainly for human consumption; new applications are still expanding. In Chile, three 'wild' Lessonia species and Macrocystis pyrifera are under a strong and increasing pressure of exploitation mainly for alginate production and as a source of feed for abalone. Regulatory restrictions for kelp exploitation and the increased demand for biomass provided a positive environment for the installation of a kelp farming industry. Pilot-production studies demonstrated that 200. tonnes (fresh)/ha/year can be achieved and genetic diversity and breeding studies suggested that this volume could be increased. Kelp disease research is a necessary condition for securing the future development of this industry, as are environmental studies on the impacts of large-scale aquaculture. Beyond the positive bioremediation, ecosystem service effects that kelp farming can provide, especially in a region such as in southern Chile, where intensive salmon and mussel cultivation occurs. Life Cycle Assessment suggests that the energy returns on investment in kelp farming are positive, but more detailed data are still required. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Concurrent studies of photosynthesis, secretion rates, reserve fluctuations and frond growth were undertaken. Net annual production is in excess of 120 g C m-2 yr-1. Over 13\% of gross carbon input is released as extracellular secretions (over 30\% in autumn) and 40-50\% is lost by distal decay, entering detrital food chains. The large concentrations of laminarin, synthesised in summer months, are nearly all lost in autumn-winter distal tissue loss and therefore not available for early spring growth. © 1977 Biologische Anstalt Helgoland.},
