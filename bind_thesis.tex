\title{MY THESIS IS GOING TO BE AWESOME} % Use all capital letters
\author{Ms Bea A. Mazing} % Use mixed upper & lower case
\prevdegrees{M.Sc. B.Sc. Hons} % Specify previous degrees, use mixed upper & lower case
\advisor{Professor H. Hound} % example: Professor Lawrence K. Forbes
\dept{Fisheries \& Aquaculture}
\date{} % alternatively, manually include month & year of your thesis submission as below
%\submitdate{January, 2025} 

% Set headers for preface sections (these are not required to be all caps any more)
\settocname{Table of Contents} % Set the table of contents name
\setlofname{List of Figures} % Set the list of figures name
\setlotname{List of Tables} % Set the list if tables name
\setindexname{Index} % Set the index name

% Custom commands are seperated out for neatness. Put any custom commands you want to include in here

% \insertplain and \insertempty are two commands you might find useful. \insertplain inserts a single page that has no content but retains some of the formatting of the previous page (ie page numbers). \insertempty inserts a completely empty page with nothing on it at all.

%% Main chapter texts (required, obviously)
% I've customised my lists of tables and figures to include the chapters as sub-headings so you know where the figures/tables sit. 
% However, if a chapter has no figures/tables, that looks weird. As a workaround, the formatting file below can be copied, modified and re-inserted before any chapter to change which headers appear in which lists. 
\input{technical/formatting/general_intro} 

% I've included the chapter titles in this document INSTEAD of in the seperate tex files. That way, you can comment out the main content here for faster/piecemeal compiling but keep all the headings and lables, and the chapter numbers don't get messed up.

\include{chapters/C1_general_intro}

\chapter{This is the full title of my first data chapter
        }\label{chap:1st-data}
% If you've already published a chapter of your thesis before submission then inserting it unchanged can make the flow seem disruptive. Previous IMAS students (e.g. Keeley, 2015) have included a little ``framed abstract'' before published chapters to briefly contextualise the chapter in terms of the rest of the thesis.
% If you want to do that, then add these next lines before the chapter begins:
\begin{framed}
\lipsum[3] % Replace with actual content, obviously
